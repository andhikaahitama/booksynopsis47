<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://bookdownloadpagehere.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>The Original of Laura</h2><p>When Vladimir Nabokov died in 1977, he left instructions for his heirs to burn the 138 handwritten index cards that made up the rough draft of his final and unfinished novel, <i>The Original of Laura</i>. But Nabokov&#x2019;s wife, Vera, could not bear to destroy her husband&#x2019;s last work, and when she died, the fate of the manuscript fell to her son. Dmitri Nabokov, now seventy-five&#x2014;the Russian novelist&#x2019;s only surviving heir, and translator of many of his books&#x2014;has wrestled for three decades with the decision of whether to honor his father&#x2019;s wish or preserve for posterity the last piece of writing of one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century. His decision finally to allow publication of the fragmented narrative&#x2014;dark yet playful, preoccupied with mortality&#x2014;affords us one last experience of Nabokov&#x2019;s magnificent creativity, the quintessence of his unparalleled body of work.<br><br><i>Photos of the handwritten index cards accompany the text. They are perforated and can be removed and rearranged, as the author likely did when he was writing the novel. </i><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p>Vladimir Nabokov was born in 1899, in St. Petersburg, Russia. His acclaimed works of fiction include <i>Lolita, Pnin,</i> and <i>Pale Fire,</i> among others. He died in Montreux, Switzerland, in 1977.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i><i>Excerpted from the introduction by Dmitri Nabokov</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> As a tepid spring settled on lakeside Switzerland in 1977, I was called from abroad to my father&#x2019;s bedside in a Lausanne clinic. During recovery from what is considered a banal operation, he had apparently been infected with a hospital bacillus that severely lessened his resistance. Such obvious signals of deterioration as dramatically reduced sodium and potassium levels had been totally ignored. It was high time to intervene if he was to be kept alive.<br> &nbsp;<br> Transfer to the Vaud Cantonal University Hospital was immediately arranged, and a long and harrowing search for the noisome germ began.<br> &nbsp;<br> My father had fallen on a hillside in Davos while pursuing his beloved pastime of entomology, and had gotten stuck in an awkward position on the steep slope as cabin-carloads of tourists responded with guffaws, misinterpreting as a holiday prank the cries for help and waves of a butterfly net. Officialdom can be ruthless; he was subsequently reprimanded by the hotel staff for stumbling back into the lobby, supported by two bellhops, with his shorts in disarray.<br> &nbsp;<br> There may have been no connection, but this incident in 1975 seemed to set off a period of illness, which never quite receded until those dreadful days in Lausanne. There were several tentative forays to his former life at the <i>h�tel </i>Palace in Montreux, the majestic recollection of which floats forth as I read, in some asinine electronic biography, that the success of <i>Lolita </i>&#x201c;did not go to Nabokov&#x2019;s head, and he continued to live in a <i>shabby Swiss hotel.</i>&#x201d; (Italics mine.)<br> &nbsp;<br> Nabokov did begin to lose his own physical majesty. His six-foot frame seemed to stoop a little, his steps on our lakeside promenades became short and insecure.<br> &nbsp;<br> But he did not cease to write. He was working on a novel that he had begun in 1975&#x2014;that same crucial year: an embryonic masterpiece whose pockets of genius were beginning to pupate here and there on his ever-present index cards. He very seldom spoke about the details of what he was writing, but, perhaps because he felt that the opportunities of revealing them were numbered, he began to recount certain details to my mother and to me. Our after-dinner chats grew shorter and more fitful, and he would withdraw into his room as if in a hurry to complete his work.<br> &nbsp;<br> Soon came the final ride to the H�pital Nestl�. Father felt worse. The tests continued; a succession of doctors rubbed their chins as their bedside manner edged toward the grave- side. Finally the draft from a window left open by a sneezing young nurse contributed to a terminal cold. My mother and I sat near him as, choking on the food I was urging him to consume, he succumbed, in three convulsive gasps, to congestive bronchitis.<br> &nbsp;<br> Little was said about the exact causes of his malady. The death of the great man seemed to be veiled in embarrassed silence. Some years later, when, for biographical purposes, I wanted to pin things down, all access to the details of his death would remain obscure.<br> &nbsp;<br> Only during the final stages of his life did I learn about certain confidential family matters. Among them were his express instructions that the manuscript of <i>The Original of Laura </i>be destroyed if he were to die without completing it. Individuals of limited imagination, intent on adding their suppositions to the maelstrom of hypotheses that has engulfed the unfinished work, have ridiculed the notion that a doomed artist might decide to destroy a work of his, what- ever the reason, rather than allow it to outlive him.<br> &nbsp;<br> An author may be seriously, even terminally ill and yet continue his desperate sprint against Fate to the last finish line, losing despite his intent to win. He may be thwarted by a chance occurrence or by the intervention of others, as was Nabokov many years earlier, on the way to the incinerator, when his wife snatched a draft of <i>Lolita </i>from his grasp.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> ----<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> My father&#x2019;s recollection and mine differed regarding the color of the impressive object that I, a child of almost six, distinguished with disbelief amid the puzzle-like jumble of buildings in the seaside town of Saint-Nazaire. It was the immense funnel of the <i>Champlain, </i>which was waiting to transport us to New York. I recall its being light yellow, while Father, in the concluding lines of <i>Speak, Memory, </i>says that it was white.<br> &nbsp;<br> I shall stick to my image, no matter what researchers ferret from historical records of the French Line&#x2019;s liveries of the period. I am equally sure of the colors I saw in my final onboard dream as we approached America: the varying shades of depressing gray that colored my dream vision of a shabby, low-lying New York, instead of the exciting skyscrapers that my parents had been promising. Upon disembarking, we also saw two differing visions of America: a small flask of Cognac vanished from our baggage during the customs inspection; on the other hand, when my father (or was it my mother? memory sometimes conflates the two) attempted to pay the cabbie who took us to our destination with the entire contents of his wallet&#x2014;a hundred-dollar bill of a currency that was new to us&#x2014;the honest driver immediately refused the bill with a comprehending smile.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the years that had preceded our departure from Europe, I had learned little, in a specific sense, of what my father &#x201c;did.&#x201d; Even the term &#x201c;writer&#x201d; meant little to me. Only in the chance vignette that he might recount as a bedtime story might I retrospectively recognize the foretaste of a work that was in progress. The idea of a &#x201c;book&#x201d; was embodied by the many tomes bound in red leather that I would admire on the top shelves of the studies of my parents&#x2019; friends. To me, they were &#x201c;appetizing,&#x201d; as we would say in Russian. But my first &#x201c;reading&#x201d; was listening to my mother recite Father&#x2019;s Russian translation of <i>Alice in Wonderland.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> We traveled to the sunny beaches of the Riviera, and thus finally embarked for New York. There, after my first day at the now-defunct Walt Whitman School, I announced to my mother that I had learned English. I really learned English much more gradually, and it became my favorite and most flexible means of expression. I shall, however, always take pride in having been the only child in the world to have studied elementary Russian, with textbooks and all, under Vladimir Nabokov.<br> &nbsp;<br> My father was in the midst of a transition of his own. Having grown up as a &#x201c;perfectly normal trilingual child,&#x201d; he nonetheless found it profoundly challenging to abandon his &#x201c;rich, untrammeled Russian&#x201d; for a new language, not the domestic English he had shared with his Anglophone father, but an instrument as expressive, docile, and poetic as the mother tongue he had so thoroughly mastered. <i>The Real Life of Sebastian Knight, </i>his first English-language novel, cost him infinite doubt and suffering as he relinquished his beloved Russian&#x2014;the &#x201c;Softest of Tongues,&#x201d; as he entitled an English poem that appeared later (in 1947) in the <i>Atlantic Monthly. </i>Meanwhile, during the transition to a new tongue and on the verge of our move to America, he had written his last significant freestanding prose work in Russian (in other words, neither a portion of a work in progress nor a Russian version of an existing one). This was <i>Volshebnik </i>(<i>The Enchanter</i>), in a sense a precursor of <i>Lolita. </i>He thought he had destroyed or lost this small manuscript and that its creative essence had been consumed by <i>Lolita. </i>He recalled having read it to group of friends one Paris night, blue-papered against the threat of Nazi bombs. When, eventually, it did turn up again, he examined it with his wife, and they decided, in 1959, that it would make artistic sense if it were &#x201c;done into English by the Nabokovs&#x201d; and published.<br> &nbsp;<br> That was not accomplished until a decade after his death, and the publication of <i>Lolita </i>itself preceded that of its fore- bear. Several American publishers, fearing the repercussions of the delicate subject matter of <i>Lolita, </i>had abstained. Convinced that it would remain forever a victim of incomprehension, Nabokov had resolved to destroy the draft, and it was only the intervention of V�ra Nabokov that, on two occasions, kept it from going up in smoke in our Ithaca incinerator.<br> &nbsp;<br> Eventually, unaware of the publisher&#x2019;s dubious reputation, Nabokov consented to have an agent place it with Girodias&#x2019;s Olympia Press. And it was the eulogy of Graham Greene that propelled <i>Lolita </i>far beyond the trashy tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, inherited by Girodias from his father at Obelisk, and along with pornier Olympia stablemates, on its way to becoming what some have acclaimed as one of the best books ever written.<br> &nbsp;<br> The highways and motels of 1940s America are immortalized in this proto&#x2013;road novel, and countless names and places live on in Nabokov&#x2019;s puns and anagrams. In 1961 the Nabokovs would take up residence at the Montreux Palace and there, on one of their first evenings, a well-meaning maid would empty forever a butterfly-adorned gift wastebasket of its contents: a thick batch of U.S. road maps on which my father had meticulously marked the roads and towns that he and my mother had traversed. Chance comments of his were recorded there, as well as names of butterflies and their habitats. How sad, especially now when every such detail is being researched by scholars on several continents. How sad, too, that a first edition of <i>Lolita, </i>lovingly inscribed to me, was purloined from a New York cellar and, on its way to the digs of a Cornell graduate student, sold for two dollars.</p><h2>The Marriage Covenant - FARSI (Persian Edition)</h2><p>Is your marriage less than what you envisioned?

Its restriction to the British Isles alone allows far more detail and more local information, and identification which is made easier with the inclusion of extensive maps. Includes specific details about plants appearing in certain areas and coloured maps designed to make location and identification easy, this book also includes details of local specialities for the Isles of Scilly. Also featured is an illustrated survey of recently disappeared British and Irish plants, some of which may return. With over 2000 detailed colour paintings and more than 800 maps, this is the most extensively illustrated wild flower guide to Britain and Ireland yet. Coloured, boxed keys to plants in complex or difficult groups are provided to assist ID. The Wild Flowers of Britain and Ireland features information about grasses, which are often omitted in other, shorter books, along with sedges, rushes, horsetails and clubmosses. Ferns, though not strictly speaking flowering plants, are also included too.</p><p>Marjorie Blamey is the doyenne of European botanical artists, the best known internationally and the most successful: her earlier books have sold over a million copies. Before devoting herself to botanical illustration in middle age, Mrs Blamey had in turns been a professional actress, photographer, wartime ambulance driver, and for 20 years a farmer&#39;s wife. She and her co-worker husband, Philip, live in St Germans, Cornwall. Richard Fitter lives in Chinnor, Oxfordshire and is the most experienced writer of field guides in Britain. He combines an encyclopaedic knowledge of British natural history with absolute clarity and precision in description and, like Marjorie Blamey, a level of energy rare in people half their age - both are in their 80s, yet constantly working on new projects. Alastair Fitter is a mere 52, Richard&#39;s second son and Professor of Biology at the University of York. Already the author of earlier guides with his father and with Marjorie Blamey, here he has contributed all the maps.</p><h2>Only Humans Need Apply: Winners and Losers in the Age of Smart Machines</h2><p><p>An invigorating, thought-provoking, and positive look at the rise of automation that explores how professionals across industries can find sustainable careers in the near future.</p><p>Nearly half of all working Americans could risk losing their jobs because of technology.

His cooperative farm was repeatedly attacked by the KKK and subject to a total economic boycott.

Less well known but equally important is the art made for use by shamans, particularly those of the Tlingit, Tsimshian, and Haida tribes. This volume presents the first comprehensive illustrated study of the various kinds of painted and carved objects that were carried and worn by shamans as they went about their duties. <br><br>In order to form alliances with animal spirits, Northwest Coast shamans deprived themselves of food, water, and sleep during long vigils in the wilderness. The spirits that came to them in dreams and visions at such times could then be summoned to assist in healing and divinatory s�ances. Much of the ceremonial paraphernalia represents the helping spirits in the shaman's service. Certain examples, which show complex juxtapositions of many animals and human figures, depict the dreams or trance experiences of the shaman at the time he was forming his alliances. <br><br>This study places Northwest Coast shamanism in a world-wide context and demonstrates the ways its practices and beliefs are similar to those found elsewhere. Throughout the book are archival photographs&#x2014;portraits of shamans and their decaying grave houses&#x2014;as well as descriptions of their lives, exploits and performances. A discussion of the complex iconography, which includes such creatures as land otters, devilfish, oystercatchers, mountain goats, and drowning men. The heart of the book is a catalogue of the objects&#x2014;masks, amulets, storage boxes, drinking cups, clothing, drums, rattles, figure sculptures, soul catchers, staffs, crowns, and combs&#x2014;employed by shamans. More than five hundred photographs, a large number published here for the first time, show the finest examples of Northwest Coast shamanistic art in museums and private collections throughout the world. This ground-breaking study brings attention to a corpus of Northwest Coast art, that, until now, has not received the attention it merits. It will be of importance to scholars and the general reader as well as those interested in the history and practice of shamanism.</p><p>The Native American shaman is a spiritual guide and healer, a man with traditional knowledge, visionary power, and enormous tribal respect. Associated with the rituals of the shaman are objects invested with everyday magic. This lavishly illustrated record of the accoutrements of shamanism among Northwest coastal Indians is the product of 15 years of research by Allen Wardwell, former curator of primitive art at the Art Institute of Chicago. The items shown include amulets and robes, each a tangible echo of shamanistic power.Allen Wardwell was formerly the curator of primitive art at the Art Institute of Chicago.</p><h2>Pastel Horses (How to Draw and Paint/Art Instruction Program)</h2><p>Renowned for its beauty, grace, and elegance, the horse has captivated artists of all genres for ages.

From 1941 to 1943, Stein translated thirty-two of P�tain's speeches, in which he outlined the Vichy policy barring Jews and other "foreign elements" from the public sphere while calling for France to reconcile with Nazi occupiers.<br><br><i>Unlikely Collaboration</i> pursues troubling questions: Why and under what circumstances would Stein undertake this project? The answers lie in Stein's link to the man at the core of this controversy: Bernard Fa�, Stein's apparent Vichy protector. Fa� was director of the Biblioth�que Nationale during the Vichy regime and overseer of the repression of French freemasons. He convinced P�tain to keep Stein undisturbed during the war and, in turn, encouraged her to translate P�tain for American audiences. Yet Fa�'s protection was not coercive. Stein described the thinker as her chief intellectual companion during her final years. <br><br>Barbara Will outlines the formative powers of this relationship, noting possible affinities between Stein and Fa�'s political and aesthetic ideals, especially their reflection in Stein's writing from the late 1920s to the 1940s. Will treats their interaction as a case study of intellectual life during wartime France and an indication of America's place in the Vichy imagination. Her book forces a reconsideration of modernism and fascism, asking what led so many within the avant-garde toward fascist and collaborationist thought. Touching off a potential powder keg of critical dispute, Will replays a collaboration that proves essential to understanding fascism and the remaking of modern Europe.</p><p>From 1941 to 1943, the Jewish American writer and avant-garde icon Gertrude Stein translated for an American audience thirty-two speeches in which Marshal Philippe P�tain, head of state for the collaborationist Vichy government, outlined the Vichy policy barring Jews and other &#34;foreign elements&#34; from the public sphere while calling for France to reconcile with its Nazi occupiers. Why and under what circumstances would Stein undertake such a project? The answers lie in Stein&#39;s link to the man at the core of this controversy: Bernard Fa�, her apparent Vichy protector.

In 1904 Baum, wrote a story specifically for the Sunday color comic sections. These pages, illustrated by comic pioneer McDougall, ran for 36 weeks and feature some of the most innovative comic strip layouts of the era. In addition, the book features all 13 episodes of a second 1904-05 Oz Sunday feature, Scarecrow and Tinman, by famed Oz illustrator Denslow. This sumptuous volume also includes never reprinted Denslow comics from 1901-03, such as Billy Bounce (the first superhero of the comics) as well as beautiful comic features from McDougall and Oz illustrator John R. Neill. A high-quality production, full of rarely seen comic gems in their original size and colors.</p><p>At the dawn of the 20th century, L. Frank Baum created a world of wonders that was to hold a permanent place in the culture of America: The Wonderful Wizard of Oz . Then in 1904, to promote his second book, Baum, along with master cartoonist Walt McDougall, brought his famed characters to Earth in a new medium, the comic strip. Queer Visitors from Marvelous Land of Oz had arrived. At this same time, Oz illustrator W.W. Denslow, offered his own Sunday feature, Scarecrow and the Tinman. Now both of these rare cartoon features are collected for the first time, magnificently restored and presented in full broadsheet size. Join these timeless characters and explore the culture that was America over 100 years ago. You surely won't be<p> in Kansas (or anyplace like it) anymore!</p>Lyman Frank Baum (May 15, 1856 &#x2013; May 6, 1919), better known by his pen name L. Frank Baum, was an American author chiefly known for his children's books, particularly The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. He wrote thirteen novel sequels, nine other fantasy novels, and a host of other works (55 novels in total, plus four "lost works", 83 short stories, over 200 poems, an unknown number of scripts, and many miscellaneous writings), and made numerous attempts to bring his works to the stage and screen. His works anticipated such century-later commonplaces as television, augmented reality, laptop computers (The Master Key), wireless telephones (Tik-Tok of Oz), women in high risk, action-heavy occupations (Mary Louise in the Country), and the ubiquity of advertising on clothing (Aunt Jane's Nieces at Work).</p><h2>Robert Ludlum&#39;s The Moscow Vector: A Covert-One Novel</h2><p><p>At an international conference in Prague, Lt.

Megan is a suburban soccer mom who once upon a time walked on the wild side. Now she&#39;s got two kids, a perfect husband, a house with a picket fence, and a growing sense of dissatisfaction. Ray used to be a talented documentary photographer, but at the age of forty he finds himself in a dead-end job posing as a paparazzo pandering to celebrity-obsessed rich kids. Broome is a detective who can&#39;t let go of a cold case - a local husband and father who disappeared seventeen years ago - and spends the anniversary every year visiting a house frozen in time, the missing man&#39;s family still waiting, his slippers left by the recliner as if he might show up any moment to step into them. Three people living lives they never wanted, hiding secrets that even those closest to them would never suspect, will find that the past never truly fades away. Even as the terrible consequences of long-ago events crash together in the present and threaten to ruin lives, they will come to the startling realisation that they may not want to forget the past at all. And as each confronts the dark side of the American Dream - the boredom of suburban life, the thrill of temptation, the desperation that can lurk behind even the prettiest facades - they will discover the hard truth that the line between one kind of life and another can be as whisper thin as a heartbeat...</p><p>Harlan Coben is an international No.1 bestselling thriller author.

He knew, of course, that it was only in his mind&#x2019;s eye, but at times, like right now, the vision was so real he had to lower his camera and take a good hard look at the ground in front of him. That horrible moment&#x2014;the moment Ray&#x2019;s life changed completely, transforming him from a man with a future and aspirations into this Grade-A loser you see in front of you&#x2014;never visited him in his dreams or when he sat alone in the dark. The devastating visions waited until he was wide-awake, surrounded by people, busy at what some might sarcastically dub work.</p><p>The visions mercifully faded as Ray continuously snapped pictures of the bar mitzvah boy.</p><p>&#x201c;Look this way, Ira,&#x201d; Ray shouted from behind his lens. &#x201c;Who are you wearing? Is it true Jen and Angelina are still fighting over you?&#x201d;</p><p>Someone kicked Ray&#x2019;s shin. Someone else pushed him. Ray kept snapping pictures of Ira.</p><p>&#x201c;Where is the after-party, Ira? What lucky girl is getting the first dance?&#x201d;</p><p>Ira Edelstein frowned and shielded his face from the camera lens. Ray surged forward undaunted, snapping pictures from every angle. &#x201c;Get out of the way!&#x201d; someone shouted. Someone else pushed him. Ray tried to steady himself.</p><p><i>Snap, snap, snap.</i></p><p>&#x201c;Damn paparazzi!&#x201d; Ira shouted. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t I have a moment of peace?&#x201d;</p><p>Ray rolled his eyes. He did not back off. From behind his camera lens, the vision with the blood returned. He tried to shake it off, but it would not go. Ray kept his finger pressed down on the shutter. Ira the Bar Mitzvah Boy moved in a slow-motion strobe now.</p><p>&#x201c;Parasites!&#x201d; Ira screamed.</p><p>Ray wondered if it was possible to sink any lower.</p><p>Another kick to the shins gave Ray his answer: Nope.</p><p>Ira&#x2019;s &#x201c;bodyguard&#x201d;&#x2014;an enormous guy with a shaved head named Fester&#x2014;swept Ray aside with a forearm the size of an oak. The sweep was with a bit too much gusto, nearly knocking him off his feet. Ray gave Fester a &#x201c;what gives&#x201d; look. Fester mouthed an apology.</p><p>Fester was Ray&#x2019;s boss and friend and the owner of Celeb Experience: Paparazzi for Hire&#x2014;which was just what it sounded like. Ray didn&#x2019;t stalk celebrities hoping to get compromising shots to sell to tabloids like a real paparazzo. No, Ray was actually beneath that&#x2014;Beatlemania to the Beatles&#x2014;offering the &#x201c;celebrity experience&#x201d; to wannabes who were willing to pay. In short, clients, most with extreme self-esteem and probably erectile dysfunction issues, hired paparazzi to follow them around, snapping pictures to give them, per the brochure, the &#x201c;ultimate celebrity experience with your very own exclusive paparazzi.&#x201d;</p><p>Ray could sink lower, he supposed, but not without an extreme act of God.</p><p>The Edelsteins had purchased the A-List MegaPackage&#x2014;two hours with three paparazzi, one bodyguard, one publicist, one boom-mike handler, all following around the &#x201c;celebrity&#x201d; and snapping pictures of him as though he were Charlie Sheen sneaking into a monastery. The A-List MegaPackage also came with a souvenir DVD for no extra charge, plus your face on one of those cheesy-fake gossip magazine covers with a custom-made headline.</p><p>The cost for the A-List MegaPackage?</p><p>Four grand.</p><p>To answer the obvious question: Yes, Ray hated himself.</p><p>Ira pushed past and disappeared into the ballroom. Ray lowered his camera and looked at his two fellow paparazzi. Neither one of them had the loser <i>L</i> tattooed on their forehead because, really, it would have been redundant.</p><p>Ray checked his watch. &#x201c;Damn,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We still have fifteen minutes on the clock.&#x201d;</p><p>His colleagues&#x2014;both barely bright enough to write their names in the dirt with a finger&#x2014;groaned. Fifteen more minutes. That meant going inside and working the introduction. Ray hated that.</p><p>The bar mitzvah was being held at the Wingfield Manor, a ridiculously gauche banquet hall that, if scaled back a tad, could have doubled as one of Saddam Hussein&#x2019;s palaces. There were chandeliers and mirrors and faux ivory and ornate woodwork and lots and lots of shimmering gold paint.</p><p>The image of the blood came back to him. He blinked it away.</p><p>The event was black-tie. The men looked worn and rich. The women looked well kept and surgically enhanced. Ray pushed through the crowds, wearing jeans, a wrinkled gray blazer, and black Chuck Taylor Hi-Tops. Several guests stared at him as though he&#x2019;d just defecated on their salad fork.</p><p>There was an eighteen-piece band plus a &#x201c;facilitator&#x201d; who was supposed to encourage guest frolicking of all sorts. Think bad TV-game-show host. Think Muppets&#x2019; Guy Smiley. The facilitator grabbed the microphone and said, &#x201c;Ladies and gentlemen,&#x201d; in a voice reminiscent of a boxing ring announcer, &#x201c;please welcome, for the first time since receiving the Torah and becoming a man, give it up for the one, the only... Ira Edelstein!&#x201d;</p><p>Ira appeared with two... Ray wasn&#x2019;t sure what the right terminology was but perhaps the best phrase would be &#x201c;upscale strippers.&#x201d; The two hot chicks escorted little Ira into the room by the cleavage. Ray got the camera ready and pushed forward, shaking his head. The kid was thirteen. If women who looked like that were ever that close to him when he was thirteen, he&#x2019;d have an erection for a week.</p><p>Ah youth.</p><p>The applause was rapturous. Ira gave the crowd a royal wave.</p><p>&#x201c;Ira!&#x201d; Ray called out. &#x201c;Are these your new goddesses? Is it true you may be adding a third to your harem?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Please,&#x201d; Ira said with a practiced whine, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m entitled to my privacy!&#x201d;</p><p>Ray managed not to vomit. &#x201c;But your public wants to know.&#x201d;</p><p>Fester the Sunglassed Bodyguard put a large mitt on Ray, allowing Ira to brush past him. Ray snapped, making sure the flash worked its magic. The band exploded&#x2014;when did weddings and bar mitzvahs start playing music at a rock-stadium decibel?&#x2014;into the new celebration anthem &#x201c;Club Can&#x2019;t Handle Me.&#x201d; Ira dirty-danced with the two hired helpers. Then his thirteen-year-old friends joined in, crowding the dance floor, jumping straight up and down like pogo sticks. Ray &#x201c;fought&#x201d; through Fester, snapped some more pictures, checked his watch.</p><p>One more minute on the clock.</p><p>&#x201c;Paparazzi scum!&#x201d;</p><p>Another kick to the shins from some little cretin.</p><p>&#x201c;Ow, damn it, that hurt!&#x201d;</p><p>The cretin scurried away. Note to self, Ray thought: Start wearing shin guards. He looked over at Fester as though begging for mercy. Fester let him off the hook with a head gesture to follow him toward the corner. The corner was too loud so they slipped through the doors.</p><p>Fester pointed back into the ballroom with his enormous thumb. &#x201c;Kid did a great job on his haftorah portion, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d;</p><p>Ray just stared at him.</p><p>&#x201c;I got a job for you tomorrow,&#x201d; Fester said.</p><p>&#x201c;Groovy. What is it?&#x201d;</p><p>Fester looked off.</p><p>Ray didn&#x2019;t like that. &#x201c;Uh-oh.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s George Queller.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Dear God.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. And he wants the usual.&#x201d;</p><p>Ray sighed. George Queller tried to impress first dates by overwhelming and ultimately terrifying them. He would hire Celeb Experience to swarm him and his date&#x2014;for example, last month it was a woman named Nancy&#x2014;as they entered a small romantic bistro. Once the date was safely inside, she would be presented with&#x2014;no, this was for real&#x2014;a custom-made menu that would read, &#x201c;George and Nancy&#x2019;s First Date of Many, Many&#x201d; with the address, month, day, and year printed beneath. When they left the restaurant, the paparazzi for hire would be there, snapping away and shouting at how George had turned down a weekend in Turks and Caicos with Jessica Alba for the lovely and now-terror-stricken Nancy.</p><p>George considered these romantic maneuvers a prelude to happy-ever-after. Nancy and her ilk considered these romantic maneuvers a prelude to a ball gag and secluded storage unit.</p><p>There had never been a second date for George.</p><p>Fester finally took off his sunglasses. &#x201c;I want you to work lead on the job.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Lead paparazzo,&#x201d; Ray said. &#x201c;I better call my mother, so she can brag to her mahjong group.&#x201d;</p><p>Fester chuckled. &#x201c;I love you, you know that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are we done here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We are.&#x201d;</p><p>Ray packed away his camera carefully, separating the lens from the body, and threw the case over his shoulder. He limped toward the door, not from the kicks but the hunk of shrapnel in his hip&#x2014;the shrapnel that started his downward slide. No, that was too simple. The shrapnel was an excuse. At one time in his miserable life, Ray had fairly limitless potential. He&#x2019;d graduated from Columbia University&#x2019;s School of Journalism with what one professor called &#x201c;almost supernatural talent&#x201d;&#x2014;now being wasted&#x2014;in the area of photojournalism. But in the end, that life didn&#x2019;t work out for him. Some people are drawn to trouble. Some people, no matter how easy the path they are given on the walk of life, will find a way to mess it all up.</p><p>Ray Levine was one of those people.</p><p>It was dark out. Ray debated whether he should just head home and go to bed or hit a bar so seedy it was called Tetanus. Tough call when you have so many options.</p><p>He thought about the dead body again.</p><p>The visions came fast and furious now. That was understandable, he supposed. Today was the anniversary of the day it all ended, when any hope of happy-ever-after died like... Well, the obvious metaphor here would involve the visions in his head, wouldn&#x2019;t it?</p><p>He frowned. Hey, Ray, melodramatic much?</p><p>He had hoped that today&#x2019;s inane job would take his mind off it. It hadn&#x2019;t. He remembered his own bar mitzvah, the moment on the pulpit when his father bent down and whispered in his ear. He remembered how his father had smelled of Old Spice, how his father&#x2019;s hand cupped Ray&#x2019;s head so gently, how his father with tears in his eyes simply said, &#x201c;I love you so much.&#x201d;</p><p>Ray pushed the thought away. Less painful to think about the dead body.</p><p>The valets had wanted to charge him&#x2014;no professional courtesy, he guessed&#x2014;so Ray had found a spot three blocks down on a side street. He made the turn, and there it was&#x2014;his piece-o-crap, twelve-year-old Honda Civic with a missing bumper and duct tape holding together a side window. Ray rubbed his chin. Unshaven. Unshaven, forty years old, piece-o-crap car, a basement apartment that if heavily renovated might qualify as a crap hole, no prospects, drank too much. He would feel sorry for himself, but that would involve, well, caring.</p><p>Ray was just taking out his car key when the heavy blow landed on the back of his head.</p><p>What the...?</p><p>He dropped to one knee. The world went dark. The tingle ran up his scalp. Ray felt disoriented. He tried to shake his head, tried to clear it.</p><p>Another blow landed near his temple.</p><p>Something inside his head exploded in a flash of bright light. Ray collapsed to the ground, his body splayed out. He may have lost consciousness&#x2014;he wasn&#x2019;t sure&#x2014;but suddenly he felt a pulling in his right shoulder. For a moment he just lay limp, not able or wanting to resist. His head reeled in agony. The primitive part of his brain, the base animal section, had gone into survivor mode. Escape more punishment, it said. Crawl into a ball and cover up.</p><p>Another hard tug nearly tore his shoulder out. The tug lessened and began to slip away, and with it, a realization made Ray&#x2019;s eyes snap open.</p><p>Someone was stealing his camera.</p><p>The camera was a classic Leica with a recently updated digital-send feature. He felt his arm lift in the air, the strap running up it. In a second, no more, the camera would be gone.</p><p>Ray didn&#x2019;t have much. The camera was the only possession he truly cherished. It was his livelihood, sure, but it was also the only link to old Ray, to that life he had known before the blood, and he&#x2019;d be damned if he&#x2019;d give that up without a fight.</p><p>Too late.</p><p>The strap was off his arm now. He wondered whether he&#x2019;d have another opportunity, whether the mugger would go for the fourteen bucks in his wallet and give Ray a chance. Couldn&#x2019;t wait to find out.</p><p>With his head still swimming and his knees wobbling, Ray shouted, &#x201c;No!&#x201d; and tried to launch...</p></p><h2>What Good Is Grand Strategy?: Power and Purpose in American Statecraft from Harry S. Truman to George W. Bush</h2><p><p>Grand strategy is one of the most widely used and abused concepts in the foreign policy lexicon. In this important book, Hal Brands explains why grand strategy is a concept that is so alluring&#x2015;and so elusive&#x2015;to those who make American statecraft. He explores what grand strategy is, why it is so essential, and why it is so hard to get right amid the turbulence of global affairs and the chaos of domestic politics. At a time when "grand strategy" is very much in vogue, Brands critically appraises just how feasible that endeavor really is.</p><p>Brands takes a historical approach to this subject, examining how four presidential administrations, from that of Harry S. Truman to that of George W. Bush, sought to "do" grand strategy at key inflection points in the history of modern U.S. foreign policy. As examples ranging from the early Cold War to the Reagan years to the War on Terror demonstrate, grand strategy can be an immensely rewarding undertaking&#x2015;but also one that is full of potential pitfalls on the long road between conception and implementation. Brands concludes by offering valuable suggestions for how American leaders might approach the challenges of grand strategy in the years to come.</p></p><p><p>Hal Brands is Assistant Professor of Public Policy and History at Duke University.

This well-edited collection of conversations and writings reveals much about the great Italian neorealist director (1906-1977). The book charts Rossellini's metamorphosis from rich playboy who awoke belatedly to the evil of fascism to powerful moralist exposing the gratuitous cruelty, aggressive egotism, mindless conformity and spiritual vacuity of the postwar world. Rossellini talks freely about why he made specific movies, including Open City, Geramny Year Zero, Paisan, Acts of the Apostles, Stromboli and The Flowers of St. Francis. The final interview (1974) limns a self-described atheist who believed "everything is political" and viewed Western civilization as doomed.

Although he is probably best remembered for his neo-Realist films like Open City (1945) and Paisa (1946), his oeuvre included other genres and even TV films. Since he published little during his lifetime (and his other posthumously published writings apparently have not been translated), this is a useful adjunct to recent works such as Patrizio Rossi's Roberto Rossellini (G.K.

They describe encounters with such varied figures as Jackie Onassis, Camilla Parker-Bowles, Oswald Mosley and Peter Mandelson, while also relating adventures with the humble: a 'pick-nick' with the stonemasons at Kardamyli, or a drunken celebration in the Cretan mountains with his old comrades from the Resistance, most of them simple shepherds and goatherds.

Set in the corrupt and spectral Mexico City of the forties, <b>Queer</b> is the story of William Lee, a man afflicted with both acute heroin withdrawal and romantic and sexual yearnings for an indifferent user named Eugene Allerton. The narrative is punctuated by Lee's outrageous "routines" &#x2014; brilliant comic monologues that foreshadow <b>Naked Lunch</b> &#x2014;yet the atmosphere is heavy with foreboding.<p>In his extraordinary introduction, Burroughs reflects on the shattering events in his life that lay behind this work.</p><p></p><p></p></p><p>William S. Burroughs (1914-1997)&#x2014;guru of the Beat Generation, controversial&nbsp;�minence grise of the international avant-garde, dark prophet, and blackest of black humor satirists&#x2014;had a range of influence rivaled by few post-World War II writers. His many books include <b>Naked Lunch</b>, <b>Queer</b>, <b>Exterminator!</b>, <b>The Cat Inside</b>, <b>The Western Lands</b>, and <b>Interzone</b>.In an introduction, Burroughs observes that he wrote this heretofore unpublished picaresque novel in 1951, well before Naked Lunch established his reputation. He reveals that the book had its genesis in a terrible event: his accidental shooting to death of his wife, Joan, a tragedy that released the black wellsprings of his talent. The narrative recounts the hallucinatory life of William Lee, an American in Mexico City in the 1940s and his journey to Ecuador with his reluctant lover, Eugene Allerton, in search of the drug Yage. Lee is Burroughs after the killing, weighed down by guilt, drugs, lust and despair; seeking lethe. Admirerers will find an early exposition of Burroughs's later themes here, as well as a strain of gallows humor. The work is almost cinematic as it unfolds; the author is not yet experimenting with the meaninglessness of language, and, indeed it is thin in both thought and expression.

Julia Bishop is at her wit&#x2019;s end after the fraudulent business dealings and subsequent suicide of her husband, Jeremy, leave her penniless and reviled by their former friends. When Adrian Sinclair shows up on her doorstep and offers her a job as a caretaker for his elderly mother, horror novelist Amaris, the opportunity for escape from her life is just too good to pass up. Julia journeys to Havenwood, the Sinclairs&#x2019; Minnesota estate, with high hopes for a fresh start, but she soon finds life at Havenwood unsettling and at times downright frightening. The airy mansion appears to be haunted by sinister spirits, and a menacing intruder begins spying through the windows. And Julia is deeply unsettled by her own resemblance to pictures of a beautiful medium who visited Havenwood over a century ago. A late-in-the-game revelation feels somewhat improbable, but Webb expertly builds suspense and offers a thought-provoking tease in the final pages. --Kristine Huntley</p><h2>Beechers, Stowes, and Yankee Strangers: The Transformation of Florida (Florida History and Culture)</h2><p>"A beautifully written, researched, and convincing treatment of an important time and fascinating personalities in Florida&#x2019;s history."&#x2013;Mark I.

This highly illustrated survey of the genus includes species and hybrids, extensive information on cultivation and propagation, and more than 150 fine photographs.

A skilled photographer, Gardiner has assembled a collection of more than 150 breathtaking color photographs from his own and others collections. Gracious line drawings and maps also complement his text. For all its beauty, however, the chief strength of Magnolias: A Gardeners Guide is its detailed examination of the charms and challenges of growing the variety of magnolias available to contemporary gardeners. Full treatment is given to all significant species and hybrids, and particular attention is paid to cultural concerns such as siting and selecting, propagation methods, and coping with pests and diseases. Where to see and buy magnolias, who to contact, and a guide to selecting the best magnolias complete the book.

While much of the work was undertaken for specific projects, it is gathered here so as to reveal larger patterns of social interaction and cultural values that only become apparent when photographs taken over time are brought together. The evolution of Szilasi&#x2019;s work is revealed through the juxtaposition of lesser-known, never-before-published photographs with more familiar, iconic images.</p><p>David Harris is the author of Paris Itineraries: Photographs by Eugene Atget and Muybridge and the Photographic Panorama of San Francisco, 1850-1880.Text: French, English</p><h2>The Healing of America</h2><p>A lecturer shares the principles she believes are needed to reunite the country, emphasizing a return to the spiritual roots that underlie the founding of America, including the power of nonviolence and the power of community. 500,000 first printing.</p><p>Noting a spiritually motivated political activism now emerging in America, Marianne Williamson claims that traditional political activists increasingly look to spiritual wisdom for inspiration while spiritual contemplatives are increasingly eager to extend their service to the world into political realms.

Bennett was the first major female writer of science fiction and fantasy in the United States, and has been credited as the inventor of the subgenre of dark fantasy.CHAPTER 3: ARRIVALS AND DEPARTURES<br><br> In his first moments of stunned surprise it seemed to Drayton that the end of all things had come. The maddest, most impossible surmises flashed across his mind. He scarcely would have felt further amazement had Lucifer himself, in all the traditional panoply of hoofs, tail, and brimstone, risen sudden and flaming through the midst of that dreary-hued heap of mysterious Dust. Had the tables and chairs begun to move about the room on their own legs it would have appeared only the natural sequel to such an event as had just transpired. Indeed, it seemed strangely terrible that nothing more should occur. That Nature, having broken her most sacred law, the indestructibility of matter, should carry her sacrilege no further.<br><br> But had that law been broken? Was it possible that by some unheard-of property the gray powder had noiselessly, without shock or visible sign of explosion resolved the great body of his friend into the component gases to which all matter may, in one way or another, be reduced? Or was he, Robert Drayton, stark mad, and had the whole absurd, horrible episode been a part of some delirious dream?<br><br> There lay the crystal vial on the floor, where he had dropped it in his first dismay. There was the newspaper, with half of a bargain-sale advertisement extending from beneath the gray heap. And now he became aware that in the library a bell was ringing with regular, monotonous persistence.<br><br> Scarcely knowing what he did, Drayton crossed the room and lifted the telephone receiver from its hook.<br><br> "Hello, hello! What? Yes, this is James Burford's home. What's that? Mr.-Mr. Trenmore? Yes; he's here. No-I-I mean, he was here a moment ago. No; I don't know where he is or when he will be back. My God, I wish I did! What's that? You are--whom did you say?... Oh, my Lord!"<br><br> Drayton dropped the receiver and stood staring in blank horror. After a while, leaving the receiver to dangle and click unheeded, he turned and walked slowly back toward the chair on whose broad arm Terence Trenmore's cigar still glowed behind a lengthening ash. With a slight shudder he forced himself to pass his hands carefully over the chair's entire inner surface, seat, arms, and back. The leather covering retained a trace of warmth from its recent occupant; but it was most indubitably empty.<br><br> The enormity, the unprecedented horror of the whole situation swept up on Drayton like a rising tide, wiping out for a time all thought of the telephone or the person to whom he had just been speaking. With a dazed, sick look he again circled the newspaper and its burden, righted his own chair, and sat down. He had a queer feeling that some one had just played a particularly cruel practical joke of which he was the victim.<br><br> And yet--what if that gray Dust had really possessed just the terrific, unbelievable history with which Trenmore had credited it?<br><br> He strove to arrange his facts and premises in a logical and reasonable order, but found himself continually returning to that one scene--he, Drayton, sitting where he now sat; Trenmore opposite, bending over the paper; the cloud that rose, gray and nebulous, and hung in the air after his friend was gone.<br><br> Presently he was again roused from his stupor, and again by a bell. The sound came faintly from the rear of the house. Drayton waited, thinking to hear Martin pass through the reception hall on his way to the front door. Again the bell rang, and this time in a long, steady, insistent peal. Some one seemed to have placed a finger on the button and determined that it should not be removed until the door opened. Martin must be out, on an errand perhaps.<br><br> Half dazedly, as he had answered the phone, Drayton at length responded to this new demand. As he unlocked the front door and opened it a burst of summer sunshine rushed in and with it the small, angry figure of a much perturbed young lady.<br><br> "Where is he? What has happened to my brother? Who was that man at the telephone? Answer me instantly, I say! Where is my brother, Terry Trenmore?"<br><br> The questions beat upon Drayton's ears like blows, rousing him to some semblance of his normal self-possession.<br><br> "You are--you are Miss Trenmore?" he asked in turn, though a sudden conscience-stricken remembrance smote him and assured him that she was. He had terminated that telephone conversation so very abruptly. No doubt the girl had run in from Atlantic City to see her brother, called him up, and--<br><br> "I am Viola Trenmore, and I want my brother. Where is he?"<br><br> Drayton faced her with a feeling of helpless fright, though in herself, Trenmore's sister was of no terrifying appearance. Nearly as little as her brother was large, she looked even younger than the seventeen years Drayton knew to be hers. She had her brother's eyes, azure as an Italian sky, and her straight, fine brows and curling lashes were black--beautifully so and in vivid contrast to the clear white and rose of her eager face, flushed now like an excited child's. Her small, modish hat, trim pumps, and tailored suit, all matched in color the bright, clear hue of her eyes. Despite his desperate preoccupation, Drayton's first sight of Viola Trenmore brought him the same momentary flash of joy that comes with the sight of a bluebird in springtime. She was like a bluebird, fluttering in from the sunshine. His troubled mind scarcely recognized the thought, but always afterward he remembered that first beauty of her as the flash of a bluebird's wing.<br><br> "What have you done with him?" she demanded, while from those blue eyes there blazed the very twin spirit of Terence Trenmore--Terence the impetuous, angered and scorning all caution.<br><br> "I hardly know what to tell you, Miss Trenmore," began Drayton hesitatingly. "Your brother is not here. He has gone. Oh, but I don't myself know what has happened, or whether I am sane or crazy! Come in here, Miss Trenmore, and you shall at least hear the story."<br><br> Puzzled now, and watching him with a sort of alert wariness, Viola obeyed his gesture and entered the library. And there, in halting, broken sentences, Drayton told his incredible tale. He showed her the Dust on the paper, the empty crystal vial, the half-smoked cigar, whose fire had expired some minutes since, like a last living trace of the man who had lighted it.<br><br> And somehow, as Drayton talked, he knew that it was all true, and that Trenmore was dead. Dead and dissipated to the elements as thoroughly as if, instead of a bare half hour, ten thousand years had slipped by since his going. Grief clutched Drayton's throat and he finished his story in a hoarse, barely audible whisper.<br><br> "And so--he was gone! Like that. And nothing left. Nothing but that infernal stuff there that--that murdered him--my friend!"<br><br> For one moment the girl stood silent, and Drayton thought that she also was dazed, as he had been. But suddenly she flung back her head with Trenmore's very gesture.<br><br> "I don't believe you!" she cried vehemently. "I don't believe you! Did you expect me to believe you? Do you take me for an infant? Who are you that are here in my cousin's house, answer his telephone and his door, and meet me with this mad lie about Terry? I recognize that vial! And I know that some one has been trying to steal it from my brother. Are you that thief, and have you murdered Terry, as you threatened you would?"<br><br> She advanced upon him, her eyes two pools of blue, indignant fire; but the man stood his ground. "I am Robert Drayton," he said.<br><br> "Robert Drayton! But you can't be. Mr. Drayton is a good friend of Terry's, though I've never met him, and some way you know that and hope to deceive me! Mr. Drayton would not treat me like this. He would not lie to me. He would not-" Sobbing at last, she broke off and clenched her little hands fiercely. "I'll show you!" she cried. "I'll show you what I think of you and your lies, and then I'll make you tell me the true story!"<br><br> Before Drayton, springing forward with a cry of wild protest, could prevent, she had dropped on her knees beside the heap of Dust. Another instant and her white-gloved fingers had again raised that ominous gray cloud.<br> It rose in a spiral swirl--<br><br> For a second Drayton still saw her as a vague, translucent blur of blue shading into pink where her face had been. Then the air shimmered and cleared, and once more the unfortunate young man stood alone in Burford's pleasant library. This time not so much as a lighted cigar remained to remind him of recent companionship.<br><br> Mr. Robert Drayton began to swear. Serious profanity had never come easily to his lips. Now, however, he heard himself using phrases and words which he had not even been aware that he knew; a steady, low-voiced, earnest stream of expression whose utterance gave him the strangest satisfaction and relief. He swore for two minutes without a pause, then trailed off into silence. The superhuman tension had been broken, however, and he could again think.<br><br> This abruptness and totality of disappearance, that left him not so much as a corpse to mourn, awoke in him emotions different from any he had ever experienced. He found that he could not think of Trenmore and his sister as other than alive, nor rid himself of the idea that in some way they were yet present in the library. Not though the very clearest memory informed him that before his eyes those two had been resolved to nothingness.<br><br> Pondering on what he should do, however, it came to him that in honor only one course lay open. Had he been content to indulge Trenmore's superstitious regard for that infernal Dust, he would have been left confronting no such ghastly mystery. The fault, by this reckoning, was his. Let him pay, then.</p><h2>Garden Wisdom: Lessons Learned from 60 Years of Gardening</h2><p><p>Step into the garden with writer and rural historian Jerry Apps.

Remarkable photographs show the West's natural wonders, tracing the Colorado River and its major tributary, the Green River, from beginning to end. The rivers flow through many habitats from treeless tundra to coastal desert, encompassing millions of years of geological history. On their way to the sea, the Colorado and the Green bend through more than a dozen national parks, monuments, wildlife refuges, and recreation areas, and nourish wildlife from majestic moose to fifty-pound trout to tiny lizards. Enjoy descriptions of river communities and some of the best fishing holes and recreation areas along the way, as well as facts about glaciers, dinosaurs, miners, and mountain men. Ride along (staying dry all the way) through the vast Colorado River Basin, which covers more land area than Spain and Portugal combined, and of course through the unforgettable colors and vistas of the grandest canyon on earth.</p><p>Jim Turner grew up in Tucson, Arizona, and received his master s degree in U.S. history from the University of Arizona.

Tour.</p><p>Carl Goldberg, Ph.D. was Associate Professor of Psychiatry at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Adjunct Associate Professor of Social Science at New York University.An original and invigorating contribution to our thinking on why certain people become cruel and violent. Psychoanalyst Goldberg's main achievement is to offer a convincing psychological account of what he terms ``malevolence'' while avoiding the trap of determinism, whether psychological, sociological, or historical. He insists that abusive and violent acts, however much influenced by early suffering and despair, are freely chosen by their perpetrators, who remain morally accountable for their actions. A series of choices made throughout life, he claims, from small acts of violation (such as crossing a lawn with a keep off the grass sign) to increasingly greater ones, determine one's character and eventually do destroy one's ability to choose good. At the root of malevolence Goldberg puts the secret feeling of shame. Using case histories from his own practice, the author (a former professor of psychiatry at Albert Einstein College of Medicine) illustrates how a sensitive child who is shamed learns to shift his contempt for himself onto others, who are then seen as deserving the abuse he heaps on them, while he himself, by means of magical thinking, becomes a superior being, free to do as he pleases. But despite his case study of a young Serb who took part in a village massacre and his analysis of the dark symbiosis between Jim Jones and his cult followers, Goldberg fails to support his claim that his theory of shame can explain the violence we have seen in Bosnia and Nazi Germany. Nevertheless, this is an innovative contribution to the needed recuperation of the notion of individual responsibility, yet also a reminder that our common humanity requires that we attempt to understand evildoers--only then can we help them and try to prevent others from going down the same path. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Seven hundred and fifty photographs unravel the mysteries of the method and provide practical application on the spot.<p> Each technique is further explained in terms of how it makes the food taste: What happens, for example, if you cook the fish in butter versus oil? Why does roasting make vegetables taste so good? How do you decide whether you want to make a chicken stew or sautT?</p><p> Here are answers to just about every cooking question, from the simple to the sublime: how to boil an artichoke or cook a soft-boiled egg, or how to clean soft-shell crabs or even butcher and roast a whole saddle of lamb. Knowing how to execute a technique makes you efficient; knowing why you've chosen that technique makes you a master.</p><p></p><p></p></p><p>After reading <i>Essentials of Cooking</i>, you will grill any fish with confidence, make delicious gratins using whatever vegetables are nicest at the market, and know that any pilaf, risotto, or paella you cook will come out just right. Author James Peterson's goal is to get people to cook comfortably without hewing to the precision of recipes and to feel relaxed in the kitchen whatever the task. Peterson accomplishes this by combining text with detailed color photos and paying attention to everything that makes a cook proficient. He teaches both small techniques, such as how to hold a swivel peeler, as well as large ones, such as how to determine the doneness of a steak, roast, or fish using just touch and sight and how to dress a salad by coating the leaves with oil, then dissolving salt in a spoon with vinegar and drizzling this over the greens before tossing them. In every case, the 1,100-plus color shots give a precise picture of what the reassuring text explains.<p> To teach skills and technique, Peterson leads you, for example, through sweating the leeks for Pureed Leek and Potato Soup in butter, then cooking the potatoes until they soften, and so on. This explanation includes no quantities or timing. Peterson's point is that these vary according to how much soup you are making, so he tells what to look for and when, enabling you to make this soup for 4 or 40. One possible drawback of this book is that you may have to consult its well-organized index when you need to locate one of the valuable hints grouped in any of the Kitchen Notes and Tips boxes, like the fact that chicken can be cooked over lower heat than steaks and chops because it takes longer to cook through. But cooks and eager students will settle into <i>Essentials of Cooking</i>, as one dives into a good novel, becoming immersed in its depth and practicality. Complete beginners might feel overwhelmed at first by the density of information and the tightly packed layout on each page. If they view this volume as a handbook, reading particular sections as needed, they will comfortably appreciate the nurturing Peterson offers their kitchen skills. <i>--Dana Jacobi</i></p>In this unrivaled practical guide, one of America's most widely respected chefs/teachers/cookbook authors distills his vast knowledge and experience into the more than one hundred essential techniques that every cook needs to know. One hundred and fifty recipes and 1,100 photographs unravel the mysteries of the method and provide practical application on the spot. Here are answers to just about every cooking question, from the simple (why you shouldn't leave slices of apples sitting in water) to the sublime (why you should want to roast a whole saddle of lamb).<p> Each technique is further explained in terms of how it makes the food taste: What happens, for example, if you cook fish in butter versus of oil? Why is the flavor of roasted vegetables so wonderful? How do you decide whether you want to make a chicken stew or saut,? Knowing how to execute a technique makes you efficient; knowing why you've chosen that technique makes you a master.</p><p> There's even an interactive element to the book: "Cues" throughout make it easy for you to delve further into related subjects that might be of interest. After you've made the mashed potatoes, you can learn how to puree other vegetables and fruits; explore how to use vegetables purees in soups or to thicken sauces or to make flans; and find out how to handle all kinds of kitchen equipment you might encounter along the way, from a ricer to a food processor to a food mill or professional drum sieve.</p><p> Expect recipes and techniques that are clearly, meticulously, and encyclopedically described in the style that has won so many awards for Peterson's books, as well as an extensive annotated glossary that you will turn to again and again. In fact, expect your experience of cooking to be forever changed.</p></p><h2>The Essential Dalai Lama: His Important Teachings</h2><p>An inspiration to millions of people worldwide, the Dalai Lama has long wanted one book that he could recommend as a basic sourcebook for his essential ideas.

As an art educator, Hale has introduced young readers to the lives and<br> works of many artists through <em>Instructor</em> magazine's Masterpiece of the Month feature andaccompanying workshops. Hale lives with family in Palo Alto, California.</p> <p></p>In an impressive debut, Stuve-Bodeen warms the heart and hearth with this sweetly evoked tale inspired by her experiences in the Peace Corps. Set in a Tanzanian village, the story tells of Elizabeti, who watches her mother care for her new baby brother and longs for a little one of her own to cuddle. She has no doll, so instead she looks around for a suitable "baby" and soon finds a rock that's shaped just right. Carefully mimicking her mother, she bathes, feeds (her doll is "too polite to burp") and changes "Eva," and when doing chores ties Eva to her back "with a bright cloth called a kanga," just as her mother does. Downcast when Eva is misplaced (her sister accidentally uses the rock for the cooking fire), Elizabeti finds her special doll in time to sing her to sleep. Stuve-Bodeen's well-balanced prose strikes just the right tranquil, gently humorous tone. She lovingly delineates the mother-daughter relationship, and offers a rare, intimate view of another culture while sounding a universal chord. Hale (Juan Bobo and the Pig), meanwhile, deftly captures the story's mood in softly shaded mixed-media illustrations, juxtaposing brightly printed motifs in African fabrics against an earthy, sundrenched palette. The artist is equally adept at conveying close-up portraits with a full emotional range as she is a village scene of Elizabeti carrying a water jug atop her head. A little slice of perfection.

Young Beorn a lame youth of fifteen, had little hope of becoming a thane or knight in King Edwin&#39;s English court. However, when the Norse hunter Bjarki-a traveler from Geatland, descendant of the first Beowulf-takes Beorn on as an apprentice thane, Beorn becomes involved in adventures he never dreamed of: slaying of the Grendel, uncovering and foiling a conspiracy against the King, and finally the conversion of Northumbria to Christianity.</p><p>A descendant of the original Beowulf comes to Northumbria to help the King rid his hall of the Grendel. The story plays out just as it did in the original Beowulf with the added intrigue of a plot to overthrow the King and the Christian conversion of Northumbria by St. Paulinus.</p><h2>The Battle of New Market</h2><p><p>In this book, William C. Davis narrates one of the most memorable and crucial of the engagements fought for control of the strategically vital Shenandoah Valley -- a battle that centered on the farming community of New Market. There, Confederate forces under the command of General John C. Breckinridge defeated the numerically superior army commanded by the Union's hapless General Franz Sigel. Outnumbered by a margin of four to one at the beginning of the conflict, Breckinridge was desperate for additional men. He sent out a call for assistance to the Virginia Military Institute, and the school responded by sending 258 members of its Corps of Cadets into battle -- some of them as young as fifteen years old. In the action that followed, 57 of them would be killed or wounded.<br>In vivid detail, The Battle of New Market tells of Breckinridge's audacious domination of the battlefield and of Sigel's tragic ineptitude; of the opposing troops, both seasoned and untried; of the fate of prisoners and of the wounded; and, perhaps most memorably, of the gallantry of the cadets who marched from the classrooms of VMI directly into the heat of battle.</p></p><p>In vivid detail, The Battle of New Market tells of Breckinridge&#39;s audacious domination of the battlefield and of Sigel&#39;s tragic ineptitude; of the opposing troops, both seasoned and untried; of the fate of prisoners and of the wounded; and, perhaps most memorably, of the gallantry of the cadets who marched from the classrooms of VMI directly into the heat of battle.<p>William C.

"The goal," he explains, "is not for us to abandon our studies in economics or education and all become preachers instead. The goal is to live like Jesus in the very soul of society."</p><p>Trent Sheppard helps to pastor an urban house churchcalled Ekklesia, and oversees Alpha&#39;s work with college students in NewEngland. He lives in Boston, Massachusetts, with his wife, Bronwyn, andtheir three children. Before moving to Massachusetts, Trent lived andworked in the UK for eight years with Youth With A Mission. His teaching and travels have taken him to fifty nations."Read <em>God on Campus.</em> It will encourage you with its stories of God?s greatness in the small places; it will challenge you to continue that close engagement with God; and, never the dry historian, Sheppard will entertain with his quirky cameos of campus life." (Patty Overend, Christian Heritage College, Australia)<br><br>"Reading Trent Sheppard's work on the history of God's movement on college campuses makes me want to go back and relive history. The way Sheppard chronicles the work of God's Spirit in the lives of individuals is compelling reading, and he entices one to imagine what God might be up to next. With great care, Trent walks his readers through instance after instance of God doing something remarkable with the lives of students who are open to His work and ends each chapter with thought-provoking questions on how God might work similarly today." (Brodie Taphorn, Youthworker.com)<br><br>"'God on Campus' is a top pick for those who think God dies when Christians go to college. Highly recommended." (Midwest Book Review)<br><br>"<em>God on Campus</em> traces a remarkable legacy of spiritual awakening that stretches from the founding of the earliest colleges in the United States to a global movement of nonstop student prayer spreading across campuses today. <em>God on Campus</em> is an invitation for students to find their place in the story of God today." (Christian News, January 11, 2010)<br><br>"College students are entering a new season of service and transformation. The message of this book will give the history, strategy and future for today's youth. I commend the author, whom I know very well, and this book. Read it and change your world." (Loren Cunningham, founder, Youth With A Mission (YWAM))<br><br>"In <em>God On Campus,</em> Trent Sheppard doesn't write history, he reads it and relates to us the ways God has visited our campuses in revival. You won't find a formula for drumming up revival in our day, but you will find a sincere call to seek God with a whole heart in daily devotion. I wept as I read some accounts in this book. I went back twenty years in my journals to the last time I thought God was going to bring revival to my campus as a student. And I'm still praying that God will change the world by awakening our campuses." (Norman Hubbard, The Navigators at the University of Illinois; author, Left of Matthew and Right of Malachi)<br><br>"Every Christian needs to read the story of <em>God On Campus. </em>Trent beautifully retells how God has shown up at colleges and universities in the past while tapping into our hope that God will do it again in our day. From the beginning of Harvard to the Methodist movement led by the Wesley brothers, from the Student Volunteer Movement to Campus Crusade, this book gives courage to anyone serving Christ within the context of higher education: campus pastors, faculty, administration and students. Most of all, it should convince the church of the vital importance of reaching this generation of college students with the transforming gospel of Jesus Christ. Reach the campus. Build the church. Change the world." (Creighton Alexander, campus coach, United Methodist Church, and director of Refresh Conference)<br><br>"Trent Sheppard digs through layers of secular calcification to authentic source--to the wellsprings of water beneath the surface of colleges, where life can still be found, where seeds of faith come back to life. Drink deeply. This book is a rare treasure of honor, honesty and vision." (Kelly Monroe Kullberg, founder of The Veritas Forum and author of Finding God Beyond Harvard)<br><br>"<em>God on Campus</em> is an inspiring narrative of courage, faith and perseverance. I am again riveted by how profoundly God uses young people who won't hide behind their youth to excuse inaction." (Dave Short, director of Campus Alpha, Alpha USA)<br><br>"As Trent Sheppard states in <em>God on Campus,</em> 'Students today want a faith that is wildly courageous, intellectually honest, socially engaged and genuinely free.' His book documents the powerful role college students have always played throughout history in what God is doing in the world, and expresses faith and gives examples that God's Spirit is stirring on campuses today."

With drama and insight, she recounts the beauty and painstaking effort of those early years spent catching babies next to crackling woodstoves, under lantern light, and in farmhouses powered by windmills for running water and with outhouses for bathrooms.<br> <br> Some births kept her from home for days on end; others she missed by heart-pounding seconds.

Edwards Deming, assessing his impact on the international business world and the practical implementation of his theories in such areas as marketing, sales, finance, and production</p><p>Journalist Gabor tells the story of Deming, an American statistician and quality control expert who was invited by the Japanese to help them develop industry in the 1950s. Since then, Deming's principles--many the elements of the much-touted "Japanese management style"--have belatedly influenced American companies such as Ford, General Motors, and Xerox. Deming's view of quality is significantly different from that of Philip Crosby ( Let's Talk Quality , LJ 4/1/89 and Quality Without Tears , LJ 4/1/84), who stresses hard work and allowing zero defects, and Russell Wright ( A Little Bit at a Time , LJ 8/90), who looks to individuals to improve quality. Deming believes only by understanding and eliminating variation from work processes will managers have the knowledge they need to eliminate deep-rooted systemic problems. Given Deming's influence and reputation, this is a must for all business collections. A review of Rafael Aguayo's Dr. Deming: The American Who Taught the Japanese About Quality (Lyle Stuart, Oct. 1990) will appear in an upcoming issue.--Ed.<br><i>-Michael D.

In this magisterial overview social historian Michael B. Katz, examines the ideas and assumptions that have shaped public policy from the sixties War on Poverty to the current war on welfare. Closely argued and lucidly written. The Undeserving Poor transcends the barriers that have channeled the American discussion of poverty and wealth into a narrow, self-defeating course, and points the way to a new, constructive approach to our major social problem.</p><p>"[A] convincing and clear historical perspective on the peculiar perceptions of poverty and welfare in the United States"--William J.

Katz's book is a broadly conceived and provocative review of America's recent efforts to help the poor and its return to punishing them. His critical analysis of the activities and ideas that fueled both the War on Poverty and its demise deserves the attention not only of academics but also of policymakers and the general reader." -- Herbert J. Gans, Columbia University</p><p>"Why Katz asks in this clear and persuasive book, do Americans debate poverty in terms of family, race. and culture rather than in the language of inequality, power, and exploitation?

The classical world: an epic history from Homer to Hadrian. xvi, 693 p., [32] p. of plates ([8] col.) : ill., maps, plans ; 25 cm.. . Includes bibliographical references (p. 627-659) and index.. .</p><p><b>Robin Lane Fox</b> is a Fellow of New College, Oxford, where he has been a University Reader in Ancient History since 1990. His previous books include <i>Alexander the Great</i>, <i>Pagans and Christians</i>, and <i>The Unauthorized Version: Truth and Fiction in the Bible</i>. He writes a regular column in the <i>Financial Times</i>. He lives in Oxford, England.Greek and Latin may long since have lost their central place in Western education, but the influence of the classical world on our own culture remains very strong. It's there in language and law, and far more vividly present in ideas and ways of thinking about the world. Both the name and concept of democracy came from the Greeks (even if in practice ancient democracies varied massively from each other and their modern counterparts). A century ago, people were fond of comparing the British Empire to that of Rome, and nowadays it is common to look at America in the same way. The great Greek historian Thucydides would have been delighted but not surprised by such analogies; when he chronicled the struggle between Athens and Sparta in the 5th century B.C., he claimed that the events he described would be "repeated in much the same way in the future." <p>In reality, the parallels are rarely so neat, and all too often people twist the past to confirm their own preconceptions. The Nazis used the writings of Roman authors such as Tacitus to bolster their ideological claims about the inherent moral and martial superiority of the German race. That was an extreme case -- at one point, Himmler even tried to seize the oldest manuscript of one of Tacitus's books -- but even today, commentators with different political backgrounds will often draw radically opposing conclusions from the same episode in Greek or Roman history.</p><p>We need to understand the past on its own terms before trying to draw any lessons from it, and for this and other reasons, Robin Lane Fox's splendid The Classical World is to be especially welcomed. Lane Fox, who teaches at Oxford, is that rarest of writers: a distinguished academic who is willing and able to address a general audience. This latest book presents a survey of Greek and Roman culture over some 900 years, beginning with the era of Homer and ending with the rule of the Roman Emperor Hadrian. It is not a narrative history -- events such as the Peloponnesian War or Alexander the Great's campaigns are skimmed over -- but the discussion has a chronological framework, ensuring that we are not presented with a simplistic view of unchanging attitudes and beliefs.</p><p>This is a big book, but the subject is truly vast. In spite of this scope, the book's pace never slackens, and it remains readable throughout. Lane Fox makes no attempt to hide the vast gaps in our knowledge; phrases like "in my opinion" occur frequently, warning the reader that other interpretations are possible, even if there is no time to discuss them. </p><p>Evidence or lack thereof dictates what we can say about the ancient world, of course. Important figures such as the Athenian statesman Pericles remain quite shadowy, and it is very hard to gain a sense of what the great man was like. Not until the entry of King Philip II of Macedon and his son, Alexander the Great, do key characters in the story register more as human beings, although the sheer scale and speed of the latter's achievements will always make him something of an enigma. This changes when we come to the centuries of Roman dominance, when the reader gets far more vivid impressions of men like Pompey and Caesar, Cicero and Pliny, Augustus and Hadrian. This is simply a reflection of the sources Lane Fox has to work with, for biographies and even private letters survive from many of these men (it is invariably a question of men since even the most influential women of the imperial court remain vaguely known figures). </p><p>Although the scope of The Classical World is broad, it deals primarily with the lives and attitudes of the wealthy elite. We know relatively little about the less well off, even in democratic Athens, and we know almost nothing about the poorer inhabitants of other Greek cities. So we do not get much sense of the lives of the majority of the population, although this would be a little more feasible in the Roman era. Three main themes of The Classical World -- justice, liberty and luxury -- are each shaped by the perspective of the upper class. For instance, Roman justice was never supposed to be blind but to take full and favorable account of a person's wealth and status. Or consider another recurring topic, the importance of horses and hunting. Few academics mention such things other than in passing, but Lane Fox -- himself an experienced equestrian and hunter -- justifiably stresses these quintessentially aristocratic concerns. </p><p>Lane Fox's survey deserves to be widely read. Indeed, I cannot think of a better introduction to the subject for those with no prior knowledge. Whether or not you agree with all his interpretations -- and many will not -- no one will doubt that these are the considered opinions of someone with a deep knowledge of the subject. (Personally, I am unconvinced that the Roman Republic "could, indeed should, have survived" Julius Caesar after he had become dictator, or that it would have survived had Mark Antony been assassinated along with Caesar.) Still, Lane Fox's strong and clear narrative will stimulate those reacquainting themselves with this fascinating era as much as it enthralls newcomers. </p><p>Reviewed by Adrian Goldsworthy <br>Copyright 2006, The Washington Post.

That experience provided grist for this book, a self-help miscellany with a hyperactive design that veers from The Onion-style parody ("Man Uses Photoshop to Give Himself Bigger Penis," "Pug Porn," etc.) to confessional essays ("Pleasuring Myself in Prison") to product tests (Viagra, porn) to anatomy lessons ("In search of...the Prostate Gland"). Goad's savage wit is matched only by his enthusiasm, both of which are a bit of an acquired taste; sensitive readers may find themselves repeatedly and unapologetically offended. Though he's been criticized as a misogynist, Goad is just as critical of himself as he is of the opposite sex, if not more so, detailing his pitiful attempts to photograph his privates ("it looked like a shriveled pink egg roll") and warning female readers, "You'll be very, very disappointed the first time you have sex with me." This self-effacing humor gives the book depth and makes Goad more likable; his decidedly un-P.C. take on all things sexual brings a welcome bit of pointed, occasionally venomous satire to the sex manual genre. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The 12th Pennsylvania Cavalry was engaged in major actions such as the Second Manassas Campaign, Antietam, Second Winchester, and Early&#x2019;s 1864 invasion. When not contending with the Army of Northern Virginia, they spent the balance of their service attempting to shield the Yankee-occupied Shenandoah Valley from guerrilla attacks led by Harry Gilmor and John Singleton Mosby.</p><p>This study of the 12th Pennsylvania Cavalry offers a rare look at the role of the Union cavalry in major campaigns as well as guerrilla warfare.Larry B.

Thousands of these young men, draft dodgers, took any means to avoid compulsory military service. Some left the country, many turned to conscientious objector (CO) status, while others feigned physical or psy chological problems to avoid the draft "legally." This volume is their story in interview form, as compiled by Gottlieb over a two-year period in southern California. Contributors run from actor Chevy Chase to mostly obscure men. While many had legitimate moral objec tions to an unjust war in Southeast Asia, others opposed military service or admittedly were afraid. Although there is no literary merit here, some testimonies will stir strong emotion in readers, especially anyone who ever served in the military. If the truth hurts, then this book carries quite an impact. Nevertheless, it is an important volume. Scholars will still want to turn to Chance and Circumstance : The Draft , the War and the Vietnam Generation (LJ 4/1/78). Highly recommended. For one CO's tale, see John Balaban's Remembering Heaven's Face: A Moral Witness in Vietnam, LJ 5/15/91.--Ed.<br><i>- Boyd Childress, Auburn Univ. Lib., Ala.</i><br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.Opposition to war is as old as war itself but, writes Gottlieb, a Southern California bookseller, who collected these oral histories, resistance to the draft during the Vietnam War was also fueled by 1960s moral and political consciousness and the failure of government to make credible the Communist menace. While many draft evaders sought refuge abroad or went to prison, 172,000 draftees, citing pacifists and religious convictions, served periods of alternative service. Draft dodgers also employed a variety of ingenious scams, from flunking or falsifying physical and mental tests and records (often in connivance with physicians) to feigning drug addiction or homosexuality, or by prolonging their academic studies. Draft evaders of that era might find the book nostalgic, but other readers will wonder at its point, especially since few of the contributors have interesting observations to make. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Love for Lydia</h2><p>Lydia Aspen, a lonely English teenager of the 1930s, learns that men are intrigued by her and seeks to hide her vulnerability by bending them to her frivolous will</p><p><b>H.

He&#x2019;s been called mean, arrogant, brash, and unapologetic, but his stinging barbs and smug personality have also earned him cheers from fans, as well as millions of dollars, a string of exotic beauties, and industry clout to develop his own projects.

Islamic, martial, civilized, and tolerant, it advanced in three centuries from the dusty foothills of Anatolia to rule on the Danube and the Nile; at its height, Indian rajahs and the kings of France beseeched the empire&#39;s aid. In its last three hundred years the empire seemed ready to collapse, a prodigy of survival and decay. In this striking evocation of the empire&#39;s power, Jason Goodwin explores how the Ottomans rose and how, against all odds, they lingered on. In doing so, he also offers a long look back to the origins of problems that plague present-day Kosovars and Serbs.</p><p>Jason Goodwin, a young English journalist, writes history as if it were today's breaking news, and with <i>Lords of the Horizon</i>, he delivers an anecdote-filled and breezy account of the long, troubled career of the Ottoman Empire. That empire endured for nearly 600 years and embraced not only a large territory--stretching, at one point, from the border of Iran to the gates of Vienna--but also hundreds of ethnic groups and three dozen nations. United under the banner of a tolerant form of Islam, the Ottoman Turks forged a culture that, Goodwin writes, "was such a prodigy of pep, such a miracle of human ingenuity, that contemporaries felt it was helped into being by powers not quite human--diabolical or divine, depending on their point of view."<p> Drawing on memoirs by European visitors as well as standard histories of the era, Goodwin traces the Ottoman Empire from its origins in the 14th-century collapse of the Byzantine state to its centuries-long decline and final collapse at the end of World War I. Along the way, he writes of the Ottomans' addiction to wealth (and to hiding their gold in fabulous hoards), the pleasure they took in holding picnics in their lush cemeteries, and the prowess of their elite military both in battle and in organized crime. ("The janissaries were magnificent extortionists," Goodwin notes. "People paid them not to burn their homes and business, then they paid them to come and put the fires out.") Full of vivid detail, Goodwin's narrative makes for an enjoyable introduction to this historically influential, but little understood, culture. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Historian, journalist, and travel writer, Jason Goodwin lives in West Sussex, England, with his wife and two sons.

Founding a baseball league in a neighborhood where there's at least one shooting-death per month would seem a fool's errand but, in 1991, two men--one white, one black--believed the kids were worth the effort. Unfortunately, Bob Muzikowski, a former addict- turned-devout Christian, and Al Carter, a Department of Human Services employee specializing in gang relations, agreed on little else. Muzikowski was to provide the sponsors and coaches for the New North Little League, while Carter would supply the kids. Merrill Lynch, J.P. Morgan, Continental Banks, and other firms backed the project, which was to have teams of black children coached by middle-class white males. As Coyle--who acted as one of the coaches--notes, the conflicts were inevitable: Muzikowski couldn't restrain proselytizing, while Carter, who wanted everything to reflect the kids' African-American heritage, was suspicious of the white do-gooders. Coyle's team, the Kikuyus--an ever-changing group of youngsters aged 9-12--made it to the championship game despite, as the players would say, all the ``busters'' on the team. They lost, but completing two seasons was a victory in itself given the bitter feuding between the founders. Coyle captures the speech, fears, boyish bravado, and personality quirks of the children trying to have fun in an environment in which survival itself is a daily challenge. He also reports that, as of the opening of the 1993 season, Muzikowski was charging Carter with misappropriating funds from the project; meanwhile, Carter had formed a second league. The crack of the bat heard over the sound of gunfire: a testament to the innocent courage of children, as well as to their ability to endure in spite of all, including the adults. (Film rights sold to Paramount) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>More a sociological study than a book about sandlot baseball, Coyle, senior editor of Outside magazine, takes us inside Cabrini-Green, the nation's second-largest housing project in one of Chicago's most crime-ridden neighborhoods. We enter a society whose pecking order is determined by guns and crack and where status is marked by Air Jordans. The Near North Little League/African-American Youth League came into being because of the efforts of white Bob Muzikowski, a former drug addict turned Christian insurance executive, and African American Al Carter, who worked for the city's Department of Human Services. Between them a sometimes cool political alliance existed as they strived to help the project's 8- to 12-year-olds. We meet the Kikuyus team: Calbert, the earnest, asthmatic, junk foodie; Freddie, a 44, 100-pound butterball with a great fastball; and Maurice, who always called "I got it. I got it," but seldom did. Through the imprisonments, shootings and AIDS deaths that mark the ghetto, we see the Kikuyus coalesce as a team. This heart-wrenching tome offers little hope as crack and guns continue to control the project, but as Maurice says: "It ain't really so bad, living here. In summertime, we play baseball."

I've always liked to cook. That is, as long as I didn't have to cook, I liked it. It was when I was made to cook that I hated it, because if I didn't do it they'd either fire me or, later, fire <i>at</i> me.<br><br>I learned the hard way. How to cook, that is. When I was a kid my stepfather kicked me out of the house. He was an Irish bastard. So I had to learn quick. You follow me? I think I was thirty-eight or thirty-nine years old when that Irish __ told me to cop a walk. Just kidding. I was fifteen years old. So I bounced around the pool halls until I was old enough to join the army. I was a GFU (General Flake-Up), so I was constantly on KP. The mess sergeant went out of his way to show me different recipes to cook and bake. Not because he was such a nice and generous guy. Because he was a fat, lazy SOB who wanted me to learn so he could laze around on his fat ass all day.<br><br>After the army I got married and divorced and married and divorced and, in the early fifties, somehow found myself in Cleveland, Ohio. I needed a job, so I applied for work in one of the classiest restaurants in Cleveland. The chef who interviewed me laughed like hell when I told him my references and experiences. "Joey," the chef said, "if you promise me to forget everything you've learned about cooking I'll give you a job." <i>Voil�!</i> I was in. The kitchen. As a saucier.<br><br>I learned how to make soups and sauces, and I experimented cooking with brandies and different wines. After six months I figured I had the experience to cook anywhere, even the Big Apple, my hometown. So I stole another car and drove back to New York. (I couldn't very well drive the stolen car that had taken me to Ohio back to New York.) Back in New York: another marriage, another divorce. Oh-for-three.<br><br>Anyway, I worked in different diners and restaurants around New York, cooking food and making book. Through my bookmaking partners I got an application to join a very exclusive club: the Mothers And Fathers Italian Association -- MAFIA, for short. Normally you needed a college degree to be accepted, as there were some very intelligent guys in this club. Some could <i>almost</i> read and write. But they let me slide into their club because of my cooking. They said they would "learn" me the rules and regulations as time went on.<br><br>Now, mobsters love to eat. They eat while planning crimes and they eat after committing crimes, and when there are no crimes, they eat while waiting for them to happen. And mobsters are very picky. They know what they like, and when they like it they eat all of it. And then more. Look at the stomachs on these guys the next time television shows one of them being escorted into court in handcuffs. These are some very serious eaters.<br><br>Which is why some of these recipes call for such heavy sauces. Remember the crowd I was feeding -- any meal may be their last, so it better be a good one. Crime may not pay, but it sure gives you a hell of an appetite.<br><br>So don't be scared off by the butter and cream. Just serve the richer sauces on the side instead of dumping them on top of the food.<br><br>My cooking for my mentor, my rabbi, my <i>compare,</i> Tommy Agro, came in very handy, as "T.A." was constantly on the lam. Tommy A. and his crew were forever traveling to different apartments in different states to lay low, and we'd always leave in a rush and I wouldn't even get to pack up my pots and pans and knives. "Leave them, Joey" was T.A.'s familiar refrain. "We'll buy new ones." Despite these culinary hardships, lamming it was a good experience. I was perfecting my craft.<br><br>The members of my new club ate a lot of veal and an awful lot of pasta. But that didn't stop me from experimenting with dishes. I'd never tell the crew what I was cooking if it wasn't a recipe from the old country. They wouldn't have eaten it (and they might have shot me). But once they were licking their chops, I'd let them in on the fact that they were wolfing down Mandarin Pork Roast, or Steak au Poivre, and I never received a complaint.<br><br>I cooked for the club -- among other jobs -- for about ten years. Then I had a terrible accident. I kept walking into this baseball bat and this iron pipe. Some of my pals were trying to see if my head was harder than those two instruments. It was, just barely. But because of this experience I was enticed to join another club on a sort of double-secret probation. This club was called the Full-Blooded Italians, or FBI, for short. The guys in my new club asked me to spy on the guys in my old club who had tried to kill me. I had no problem with that. Revenge, like my Cicoria Insalata, is best eaten cold.<br><br>When it came to food, the members of my new club were no different from the members of my old club. They all ate like they were going to the chair. You don't have to eat that way with the recipes in this book. You just have to enjoy them. Because they've been tested on the worst of the worst and the best of the best. And they've all passed with flying colors.<br><br>Copyright � 1993, 2001 by Joseph Iannuzzi</p><h2>A Celebration of Rare Breeds, Vol. 1</h2><p>FIRST EDITION, FIRST PRINTING with full number line.

There is plenty in this book to keep you turning the pages. Please visit the book&#x2019;s website at: www.scottgration.com.Former President Carter introduces this gripping first-person narrative that provides significant details about six headline stories not previously revealed. Captivating experiences from Scott's unique childhood&#x2014;attending boarding school at the age of seven, escaping the 1964 Congo rebellion as a refugee, and being inducted into the Masai tribe in Kenya&#x2014;jumpstart the book. Human-interest vignettes punctuate fascinating accounts of developing the Predator drone, conducting the 2003 scud hunt in Iraq, and accompanying Senator Obama to Africa in 2006. He painfully describes surviving the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia and the 9/11 terrorist attack on the Pentagon, and then recalls speaking at the 2008 National Democratic Convention and helping to birth South Sudan in 2011. His reflections at the end of the memoir highlight important lessons Scott gleaned during his unlikely journey from son of Africa to a warrior and diplomat. In 2012, Scott Gration was fired from his job as Ambassador to Kenya over disagreements with the State Department on security and other issues, including using his Gmail account to supplement the Department&#x2019;s OpenNet computer system. Since revelations about Hillary Clinton&#x2019;s private email server surfaced a year ago, he has been interviewed on CNN&#x2019;s &#x201c;State of the Union&#x201d; program and his name has appeared in numerous articles about the State Department&#x2019;s &#x201c;double standard.&#x201d; This book provides facts that have not been exposed previously.Author: Scott Gration was reared as a son of missionaries in Congo and Kenya.

However, business professionals must be able to apply their technical accounting knowledge and expertise in a broader context in making good business decisions. Moreover, because the U.S. market is increasingly service oriented, professionals must develop experience in applying these skills to decision making in a service environment. Having spent several years supplementing existing textbook problems with more real-world and service industry examples, we saw a need for a new approach. Hence, we focus on helping students to (1) develop strong analytical skills and (2) apply them in realistic decision-making contexts. Finally, we have written the book with a heavy emphasis on managerial decisions in service and merchandising enterprises. Managerial Accounting for Undergraduates is intended for use in the first managerial accounting course at the undergraduate level-one that balances the development of management accounting tools with their implementation in decision making. This book teaches future business professionals how to read, analyze, and interpret accounting and other company, industry, and economic data to make informed business decisions.</p><p></p><h2>The Prison Called Hohenasperg: An American Boy Betrayed by His Government During World War II</h2><p>Hard to find</p><p></p><h2>L5R RPG Emerald Empire L5R Companion (Legend of the Five Rings)</h2><p>Emerald Empire is a must-have for Legend of the Five Rings Role- Playing Game Players &amp; GMs who wish to bring their campaigns alive with a wealth of details about the workings of Rokugani life, as well as plot hooks and adventure ideas.

Here, John Van Seters examines the corpus of the Yahwist in Exodus-Numbers and explores the literary nature of the work, its limits in the text, its relationship to the history of Deuteronomy to 2 Kings, and its dating in the exilic period. He shows how J, the literary work attributed to the Yahwist, integrates a wide diversity of themes and subjects around the biography of Moses.<br>This book will provide a better understanding of the unity and integrity of Exodus-Numbers in the context of other writings and the general history of the exilic period. It disputes the widely held view that J is merely a collection of accumulated traditions. In Van Seters's view, J's portrayal of Moses is heavily influenced by prophetic biography and conventional historiographic forms and models, allowing the Yahwist to express a number of major theological themes that address the religious concerns of the exilic period and the diaspora community.</p><p>John Van Seters is James A.

In this edition of the Sakuteiki, the authors provide both an English-language translation of this classic work; and an introduction to the cultural and historical context that led to the development of Japanese gardening.<br><br>A Japanese court noble wrote the Sakuteiki during the Heian period (794-1184). During this critical era in Japanese history cultural influences on poetry, clothing-and gardening-that had been imported from China and Korea over the previous centuries were reexamined and reinterpreted into their unique Japanese forms. The Sakuteiki contains the first systematic record of this new gardening style-with both technical advice on gardening-building (much of which is still followed in today's Japanese gardens) and an examination of the four central threads of allegorical meaning which were integral features of Heian-era garden design.</p><p><b>Jiro Takei</b>, professor emeritus of the Kyoto College of Art, taught a course on the Sakuteiki for many years. Throughout his long and distinguished career, he has been deeply involved in the study of Japanese gardens, as the Chairman of the Japanese Garden Academic Society (Nihon Teien Gakkai), regional chief of the Gardening Academic Society (Zoen Gakkai), and chief researcher of the Research Center for Japanese Garden Art (Nihon Teien Kenkyu Senta).<br><br><b>Marc P.

As painting became a respected art form during the Renaissance, the distinction between the fine and decorative arts widened, notes Brolin (The Failure of Modern Architecture, etc.), leaving ornamentation behind. He explains why Art Nouveau and earlier styles exhibit ornamental abandon, while during the modernist period, traditional ornamentation was minimizedonly to return in full force with the onset of post-modernism. His discussions range from the nature of art, beauty and genius to the influence of economics. Illustrations. December 11<br>Copyright 1985 Reed Business Information, Inc.Brolin, a practicing architect, takes a run through the history of ornament from the ancients to the present, arguing that the infusion of morality into questions of taste and design in the 19th and 20th centuries is an aberration in the universal human love of ornament. Thus, ornament has begun to regain legitimacy recently, appearing in the work of architects such as Robert Venturi. Although nowhere as thoughtful and complex as E. H. Gombrich's various studies on ornament, Brolin's illustrated text is a useful summary aimed at a generally informed audience.

The Fur Trade History of Teton Valley, Idaho</h2><p>The story of the fur trade in Teton Valley as it has never been told before. Pierre&#39;s Hole! studies forty years of contact between native peoples and Euro-Americans in the early Rocky Mountain West, using new information that has come to light since Benjamin W. Driggs first published the valley&#39;s history in 1926. In the early 1800s, a thriving trade in furs destined for the international hat market brought trappers and increasing numbers of Indians into Idaho&#39;s Teton Basin, just across the Teton Range from Jackson&#39;s Hole. This commerce created a favorite rendezvous location and a thoroughfare for both populations. One of the most active centers of the Rocky Mountain fur trade, the Teton Basin provided the stage for many dynamic personalities and dramatic events of the era. A close look at Pierre&#39;s Hole connects the reader to the entire sweep of fur trade history in the American West, from Fort Astoria on the Pacific Coast to the trading houses of St. Louis, Missouri. Told through eyewitness accounts of men like Jim Bridger, Joe Meek, Nathaniel Wyeth and others, this Teton Valley history places the reader on the ground as the action unfolds. Drawing from trapper journals - the earliest records of the region - historian Jim Hardee fills in the presettlement gaps of the narrative: a period when Teton Valley was known as Pierre&#39;s Hole, Snake River was Lewis Fork and the Tetons were the Pilot Knobs.

Challenging this position, William Gairdner argues that relativism is not only logically and morally self-defeating but that progress in scientific and intellectual disciplines has actually strengthened the case for absolutes, universals, and constants of nature and human nature. Gairdner refutes the popular belief in cultural relativism by showing that there are hundreds of well-established cross-cultural &#39;human universals&#39;. He then discusses the many universals found in physics - as well as Einstein&#39;s personal regret at how his work was misinterpreted by the public&#39;s eagerness to promote relativism.Gairdner also gives a lively account of the many universals of human biology, including the controversial topic of universal gender differences or &#39;brain sex&#39;. He then looks at universal concepts of both natural and international law, and ends by discussing language theory. He shows how philosophers from Nietzsche to Derrida have misused linguistic concepts to justify their relativism, even though a sustained and successful effort by serious scientists and philosophers of language has revealed myriad universals of human language, ranging from language acquisition, to word-order, to &#39;Universal Grammar&#39;. From ethics to Einstein, culture to biology, law to language, &#34;The Book of Absolutes&#34; makes complex topics accessible to a broad audience and demonstrates that there are plenty of certainties, even in our postmodern world.</p><p>William D. Gairdner is a best-selling author, businessman, and independent scholar . His most recent books are Canada&#39;s Founding Debates and The Trouble with Democracy.&#34;A brilliant analysis of the chief intellectual pathology of the modern age ... Writing with wit and erudition, William Gairdner goes to the heart of the defining spiritual malaise of our time, showing (among much else) that relativism and tyranny, far from being opposing forces, actually collude to undermine genuine freedom. The Book of Absolutes is sure to emerge as a modern classic of political and moral maturity.&#34; --Roger Kimball, Editor and Publisher, The New Criterion, and Art Critic for National Review</p><h2>I&#39;m Going to Read� (Level 2): Silly Pig (I&#39;m Going to Read� Series)</h2><p>What could be funnier than a pig in a wig dancing a jig?

Using documentary records, memoirs and eyewitness accounts from all sides, Angus Konstam recreates every stage of the battle at every level as it happened, day by day, hour by hour. <br><br>His painstakingly researched account offers a fresh perspective on a decisive battle that has been neglected by British and American historians in recent years, and it gives a fascinating insight into the realities of warfare in Europe 60 years ago.</p><p>Angus Konstam is a military and maritime historian and author.

Staring up through the leaves, she measured their pace as they marched from tower to tower, noted how long and at which locations they tarried. She gave special attention to the changing of the guard, and was relieved that the same guards had been posted as on the other nights she&#x2019;d hidden here. Most important, though, was their mood. She weighed it&#x2014; as well as she could from a hundred feet below&#x2014; and to her great relief, found them attentive, but no more than usual. Had they seemed more prepared, on edge in some way, she knew she would have been forced to abandon her plan to kill the King of Kings. <br> &nbsp;<br> This great palace that sat atop Mount Tauriyat was named Eventide, and it was the home of Kiral, the King of Kings. Not only was it the highest and largest of Sharakhai&#x2019;s palaces, it was the most difficult to penetrate. Its walls stood higher than any other palace. Its western side was built atop a sheer rock face, making it near impossible for any sizable force to approach from that angle. Watch towers stood like sentinels every fifty paces, and the winding road leading up to it had a gorge spanned by a drawbridge that, unlike many of the other palaces on Tauriyat, was often raised. <br> &nbsp;<br> Not that the palace had never been breached. With enough preparation, training, and, not least of all, patience, a woman or man could pierce any wall, gain any fortress. There were stories of the Moonless Host having done so many years ago. Whether or not they&#x2019;d grown in the telling was anyone&#x2019;s guess, but one thing was certain: gaining the walls was only the first of their difficulties. There were the Silver Spears to contend with. There were the elite Blade Maidens, who protected the King. And there was the King himself who, even after four hundred years walking the sands of the desert, was still one of the Shangazi&#x2019;s most feared fighters. <br> &nbsp;<br> Careful not to rock the leafy branches, �eda leaned to one side to get a better look at a tall soldier marching along the parapet. A second Spear fol�lowed several paces behind, his helm and the tip of his tall spear glinting gold from the remains of the dying sun. From their high vantage, the two soldiers studied the vertical drop below them. Their gazes roamed the dry slope of the mountain. They stared out past the walls circumnavigating the whole of Tau�riyat, to the sprawl of the Amber City. �eda could see the city as well, an expanse of choked streets and mismatched buildings, of grand temples and leaning hovels. Some were old, some were new, some large, some small, some rich, some so decrepit they looked as if they&#x2019;d crumble the moment the next sandstorm hit. <br> &nbsp;<br> �eda&#x2019;s heart drummed as a hot breeze picked up and wind tossed the leaves. One of the guards was staring right at her. The tree, one of dozens in a grove below Eventide, did much to hide her, as did her supple leather armor, which was dyed a mottled color that matched both the fig tree&#x2019;s bark and the rocky soil. She&#x2019;d made the armor with padding that rounded her stomach, chest, and arms, making her appear bigger than she was. She&#x2019;d bound her breasts and stuffed boots too large for her feet to make anyone who spotted her think she was a man. She was not only prepared to be seen before the night was done; she counted on it. Only, it wasn&#x2019;t supposed to happen <i>now</i>. <br> &nbsp;<br> She stared at the guard, breathless, certain he&#x2019;d spotted her, but a moment later he spat over the wall, said something to his comrade, and moved on, the two of them laughing with the sort of ease that was common to the shisha dens sprinkled all across the Amber City. Indeed, as if the thought had summoned the city awake, drums and music lifted into the warm evening air, some celebration now underway. <br> &nbsp;<br> The Spears were soon lost from sight, swallowed by the gaping entrance of the next tower, and finally �eda relaxed. Still, her confidence was begin�ning to erode. Where were the other Kings? They should have been here by now. The urge to abandon this plan as too bold and return to the House of Maidens was growing, but a night like tonight wasn&#x2019;t going to come again. She&#x2019;d known weeks ago that she would come; it was practically a directive from the gods themselves, or if not the gods, then surely the fates. <br> &nbsp;<br> When the sun set and the air began to cool, �eda worried the moment had come and gone. Perhaps King Yusam&#x2019;s diary had been wrong. Or in her haste she&#x2019;d noted the wrong date. But just then the sound of galloping horses drew her attention to King&#x2019;s Road, the paved road of endless switchbacks that wound its way like a serpent up the slopes of Tauriyat to each of the Kings&#x2019; palaces. Twelve other palaces graced the mountain, but it was from Husamett�n&#x2019;s, the King of Swords, palace that an honor guard of ten Blade Maidens and a large black wagon emerged. <br> &nbsp;<br> A cavalcade of moths began to flutter in the space between �eda&#x2019;s ribs as the wagon wended its way higher along the palace road. Eyes fixed on the wagon like an archer taking aim, �eda pulled the teardrop necklace from inside her armor, took a white-and-blue adichara petal from within, and placed it under her tongue. She&#x2019;d no sooner clipped the locket closed than her awareness began to expand. <br> &nbsp;<br> Like the perfect unfurling of a freshly cut rose, more of the world became known to her. The conversations of the men and women preparing for the arrival of the other Kings&#x2014; conversations hidden from her only moments ago&#x2014; now drifted down from Eventide. The smell of roast meat filled the air, as did a savory mix of garlic, onion, and the sharp scents of lemon and cori�ander and sage. A thrill ran through her. Her physical form became vibrant, white hot. She <i>itched </i>to use it. <br> &nbsp;<br> The most subtle effect, and the most dangerous on this particular night, was her awareness of the blooming fields. These were the groves of twisted trees, the vast ring around Sharakhai where the asirim slept. Like torches in the night, they brightened in her mind. Ever since she was young, when her mother had begun feeding her bits of pressed petals on holy days or during other rites of passage, she had been bonded to the adichara. She hadn&#x2019;t known their nature then, but she did now. She could feel the asirim in their slumber, could sense their tortured dreams. <br> &nbsp;<br> She could call to them if she wished&#x2014; they&#x2019;d granted her that power&#x2014; but that wasn&#x2019;t what she needed tonight. Like the guards above, it was imperative they remain unaware of her. After all, were the Jackal King to sense her pres�ence here, all would be lost. So instead of calling to them, she distanced herself, becoming something ephemeral, spindrift lifting then lost. <br> &nbsp;<br> The distant thump of horse hooves came louder as the wagon team and the Maidens&#x2019; horses approached the entrance to Eventide. When they were lost from view and the clatter of the entrance bridge being lowered filled the cool night air, �eda stared up at the palace wall and saw a lone guard stand�ing at attention along the western side, facing inward. <br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Bless you, Nalamae. </i><br> &nbsp;<br> Low and fast, she raced to the rock face. Upon reaching it she climbed, using the path she&#x2019;d mapped for herself while waiting for the sun to set. Up she went, quickly, quietly, her body tight to the stone, arms and legs moving smoothly. She was a good climber without the power of the petals driving her, but with it, she reached the lower stone blocks of Eventide&#x2019;s walls in as little time as it took a man to piss. She moved slower then, careful to find space for the tips of her fingers to grip, for the edges of her boots to find purchase. <br> &nbsp;<br> From within the walls, echoing up into a sky bursting with stars, came the sound of pounding hooves, of iron-rimmed wagon wheels rattling over stone. She approached the top of the wall and slowly raised herself until she could see the Silver Spear. With care, she drew a pre-knotted rope from around her waist and slipped one end over the merlon directly above her. The other end, wound into a noose, she held at the ready. She made a ticking sound and waited, controlling her breath, controlling her emotions. When the Spear remained standing at the ready, she made the sound again. This time he looked out over the wall, then down. <br> &nbsp;<br> She was already swinging the rope up. It caught him neatly around the neck. Immediately she dropped, and the guard dropped with her. The noose cinched tight and he slipped over the side, arms scrabbling for purchase. His spear spun end over end toward the fig trees below. The rope went taut, and he swung like a headman&#x2019;s axe toward the wall. �eda slid along the rope so that his weight struck her instead of crashing noisily against stone. Something along his belt bit into her stomach, but he made blessedly little sound as he slammed into her. A cough escaped her, loud enough that she might have been heard. She switched her grip from the rope to the collar of his hauberk. All her weight was on him now, the noose drawing even tighter. He tried to free himself, tried to draw the knife at his belt, but it was a simple matter to snatch his wrist. The noose was so tight he didn&#x2019;t so much as gurgle. She heard a popping sound, though, and then another. A moment later, his whole body went slack. <br> &nbsp;<br> Like an ungainly ladder, she climbed his meaty frame until she was able to grab the rope, stand on his shoulders, and ascend once more. She prayed no cries of alarm would be raised as she slipped through the crenel and belly-crawled into the nearby tower. <br> &nbsp;<br> Hearing none, she rose up until she could view the courtyard through the loophole in the tower. She watched as the wagon lurched to a stop. The team of horses at the lead shook their manes as four Blade Maidens dismounted and moved to stand beside the wagon. A footman in King Kiral&#x2019;s blue livery opened the wagon doors, and three men stepped out, the Maidens and the footman bowing their heads to each. The first was the tall form of Husamett�n, King of Swords. Next came Mesut, the Jackal King, lord of the asirim. And lastly, Cahil, the Confessor King. Mesut and Cahil wore the fine clothes of the Kings of Sharakhai: khalats of vibrant cloth and thread of gold with turbans to match. In contrast, Husamett�n wore simpler clothes&#x2014; the utilitarian sort a desert shaikh might wear&#x2014; but he had a most impressive sword at his side. Night&#x2019;s Kiss, the two-handed shamshir granted him by Goezhen himself. <br> &nbsp;<br> Only when they had all exited the wagon did a fourth King appear. He came from the palace with three Blade Maidens waking in unison behind him. He was a tall, clean-shaven man. Even from this distance �eda could see the pockmarks on his skin, evidence of some childhood disease that had struck well over four hundred years ago. This was Kiral himself, the one all the other Kings deferred to&#x2014; or so �eda had thought before entering the House of Maidens. She&#x2019;d heard rumors of various rifts between the Kings since entering the House four months earlier. None of the other Kings would challenge his authority outright, but some would shed no tears were the Dawn King to topple from his lofty perch. <br> &nbsp;<br> For a time the four Kings spoke, their conversation lost in the clop of hooves as the Maidens&#x2019; horses were led away. The wagon, however, remained. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s begin,&#x201d; Kiral said as the noise dwindled. <br> &nbsp;<br> �eda pulled the short bow from her shoulder as King Mesut nodded to the interior of the wagon. At this, a Silver Spear exited, holding a chain in one hand. When he drew on the chain, it clinked, and a woman stumbled into view. As she took the steps, her miserable state was revealed. The chain was affixed to a leather collar around her neck. She was gagged. Her hands were bound behind her, and her breath came jackal-quick. She was trembling, and yet she stood tall before King Kiral; she stared defiantly into his eyes. <br> &nbsp;<br> �eda had been pulling one of the four poison-tipped arrows from the quiver on her back, but she halted at this strange occurrence. Two months ago she&#x2019;d stolen into King Yusam&#x2019;s private offices and read through his journal, the one he used to record the visions from the magical pool secreted away in his palace, his mere. The entries were snippets mostly, the most memorable bits and pieces he used to remind him of the things he&#x2019;d seen. This meeting, on this particular day, had been mentioned several times. He had not, however, mentioned this woman, which meant either that he&#x2019;d not seen it or had chosen to withhold it; she had no idea which it might be. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Where shall we begin?&#x201d; Mesut asked. <br> &nbsp;<br> �eda knew the answer even before Kiral waved to the patch of gravel situated between the greenhouse and the tower where she hid. The greenhouse had been mentioned in the journal. <br> &nbsp;<br> Indeed, they moved to that exact location, four calm Kings and the terri�fied woman. &#x201c;Kneel,&#x201d; Mesut said. When the woman didn&#x2019;t, Cahil kicked the backs of her legs out from under her so she fell to her knees. As he moved behind her and sliced through her bonds to free her hands, �eda placed the arrow across her bow and nocked it. She held it at the ready, staring through the loophole in sick fascination. She thought of releasing the arrow now but, Nalamae forgive her, this was too important. She had to know more. The mere wouldn&#x2019;t have shown it to Yusam if it wasn&#x2019;t vital to him or the Kings or Sharakhai itself. If she revealed herself too soon, they would only perform this strange ritual another time, and she&#x2019;d be none the wiser. So she waited as Cahil unstoppered a glass flask filled with a brown, muddy liquid. Waited as Mesut untied the gag and wrenched her head back. When they began pour�ing it down her throat, however, �eda lifted the bow and drew the arrow back. <br> &nbsp;<br> Finally, the flask was drained. Cahil stepped back, and Mesut let the woman go. She fell slowly to the ground, gripped in pain. She balled her hands into fists, struck them against the ground, as if waging a terrible battle within. But this was a battle already lost. Before �eda&#x2019;s eyes, the woman&#x2019;s skin shriveled. Her cheeks grew sunken. Her hands became skeletal. <br> &nbsp;<br> <i>By Bakhi&#x2019;s bright hammer, what did Cahil give her?&nbsp;</i></p></p><h2>The Griffle and the Thief (Puddle Lane Reading Programme Stage 2)</h2><p>The Griffle and the Thief (Puddle Lane Reading Programme Stage 2) [Hardcover]</p><p></p><h2>Under Attack (Home Front Detective, 7)</h2><p>June, 1917.

Originally settled by the Dutch as part of their &#34;New Netherland,&#34; New Jersey did not flourish as a colony until it came under British control in 1664. Readers will learn how the promise of political and religious freedom led to its becoming the first Quaker colony in America and one of the most ethnically diverse. They&#39;ll learn how, for a while, it was divided into East and West Jersey, how it had its own version of the Boston Tea Party, and how its location between New York City and Philadelphia made it the site of nearly 100 battles during the struggle for independence that eventually led to its becoming the nation&#39;s third state.</p><p>Robin Doak is a writer of fiction and nonfiction books for children, ranging from elementary to high school levels. Subjects she has written about include American immigration, the 50 states, American presidents, and U.S. geography. Doak is a former editor of Weekly Reader and has also written numerous support guides for educators. She holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in English, with an emphasis on journalism, from the University of Connecticut and lives near her alma mater in Portland.Gr. 5-8. Presented in clear, succinct text, this history of New Jersey stretches from the early Dutch, Swedish, and English settlements through the Revolutionary War and the adoption of the Constitution, Doak discusses political history (for 26 years East and West New Jersey were separate colonies); religion, especially the Quaker influence; and life for both European immigrants and indigenous peoples. He also touches upon the role of indentured servants, redemptioners, and slaves, as well as New Jersey's key location between New York City and Philadelphia. Historical maps, reprints of period artwork, and first-person accounts are folded into each chapter, but they don't disturb the narrative flow. Appended with a time line, a bibliography, and source notes, this resource, containing a great deal of information, will be a welcome addition to history classes and a great source for report writers. Other titles in the Voices from Colonial America series cover the other original colonies, plus Texas, California, Florida, Louisiana, and New France. <i>Kay Weisman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

In his fourth biography, he takes on the life of Hart Crane (1899-1932), a contemporary of Williams who held a similarly pivotal role in the development of American literature's avant-garde. "It would be difficult," Mariani suggests, "to find a serious poet or reader of poetry in this country today who has not been touched by something in Hart Crane's music." (However, at the time, many critics--with some of whom he had strained personal relationships--did not evaluate his work so highly, which contributed in part to Crane's dramatic suicidal leap off a ship at sea.) Crane loved New York, moving there from his hometown of Cleveland as soon as he could; even when financial straits forced him to return home to work for his father, the "white buildings" of Manhattan loomed in his imagination. <i>The Broken Tower</i> does a fine job of recreating the passionate energy and vitality of Crane's life. Mariani weaves lines from Crane's letters and poems into his narrative throughout, and while he does not skimp in his accounts of the poet's alcoholism and promiscuous sex life with other men, he treats these matters simply as components of the poet's complex personality.Paul Mariani is the author of thirteen books, among them biographies of Robert Lowell (Lost Puritan), John Berryman (Dream Song), and William Carlos Williams (A New World Naked), a finalist for the National Book Award, a New York Times Editors&#39; Choice for ten weeks, and one of the New York Times&#39;s top 100 books of the year. An acclaimed poet, Mariani has written collections of poetry, including Salvage Operations and, most recently, The Great Wheel.</p><h2>X-Factor Vol. 1: The Longest Night (X-Men)</h2><p>In the fallout from House of M and following the surprise film-noir hit Madrox, a new mutant team is forged!

What is it? And what is it for?Daniel Everett confounds the conventional wisdom that language originated with Homo sapiens 150,000 years ago and that we have a &#39;language instinct&#39;. Drawing on evidence from a wide range of fields, including linguistics, archaeology, biology, anthropology and neuroscience, he shows that our ancient ancestors, Homo erectus, had the biological and mental equipment for speech one and half million years ago, and that their cultural and technological achievements (including building ocean-going boats) make it overwhelmingly likely they spoke some kind of language.How Language Began sheds new light on language and culture and what it means to be human and, as always, Daniel Everett spices his account with incident and anecdote. His book is convincing, arresting and entertaining.</p><p>Daniel Everett worked in the Amazon jungles of Brazil for over 30 years, among more than a dozen different tribal groups. He has published extensively on language and culture and is one of the world&#39;s most influential thinkers in both fields. His Don&#39;t Sleep, There Are Snakes was selected by Blackwell&#39;s bookstores as one of the best of 2009, was an &#39;editor&#39;s choice&#39; of the Sunday Times and has been the subject of a film and a play. He is currently Dean of Arts and Sciences at Bentley University in Waltham, Massachusetts.Very few books on the biological and cultural origin of humanity can be ranked as classics. I believe that Daniel Everett&#39;s How Language Began will be one of them. -- Edward O. Wilson, University Research Professor Emeritus, Harvard University How Language Began occupies a rare literary space that explains complex issues clearly to general readers while being an original contribution to scholarship...the arguments he marshals and insights he provides are impressive...anyone interested in language would gain from reading this book. -- Oliver Kamm * Times * Ambitious...the subject-matter is completely enthralling...Everett is at the very top of his intellectual game. -- Harry Ritchie * Spectator * Important and fascinating -- Adrian Woolfson * Prospect * Everett is skilled at leavening an intellectually challenging treatise with humor ... A worthy book for general readers * Kirkus Reviews * When I first became interested in cultural evolution, cognitive revolutionaries would say that Noam Chomsky had proved that an innate language acquisition device was the key to linguistics. Daniel Everett is a leader of the counterrevolution that is putting culture and cultural evolution back at the center of linguistics, and cognition more generally, where I think it belongs. How Language Began is an accessible account of the case for a culture-centered theory of language. -- Peter Richerson, Distinguished Professor Emeritus, Department of Environmental Science and Policy, University of California Davis Praise for Language: The Cultural Tool: &#39;A book whose importance is almost impossible to overstate. * Sunday Times * Revelatory. There is nothing about humans that is quite as astonishing as language. * Guardian * Impressively modest and reasoned. * Economist * The most important - and provocative - anthropological field work ever undertaken. -- Tom Wolfe Praise for Don&#39;t Sleep, There are Snakes: &#39;A worldwide bestseller that finds no competition from linguistic researchers. * New Scientist * A remarkable book.

When it flew overhead, it left in its wake desolate cold and frozen land. But Adara was not afraid. For Adara was a winter child, born during the worst freeze that anyone, even the Old Ones, could remember. <br>Adara could not remember the first time she had seen the ice dragon. It seemed that it had always been in her life, glimpsed from afar as she played in the frigid snow long after the other children had fled the cold. In her fourth year she touched it, and in her fifth year she rode upon its broad, chilled back for the first time. Then, in her seventh year, on a calm summer day, fiery dragons from the North swooped down upon the peaceful farm that was Adara's home. And only a winter child--and the ice dragon who loved her--could save her world from utter destruction. <br><i>The Ice Dragon</i> marks the highly anticipated children's book debut of George R.R.

He has won multiple science fiction awards, including 4 Hugos, 2 Nebulas, the Bram Stoker, the Locus Award, the World Fantasy Award, the Daedelus, the Balrog, and the Daikon (Japanese Hugo).&nbsp;Chapter One<br>Winter&#x2019;s Child<br>&nbsp;<br>Adara liked the winter best of all, for when the world grew cold the ice dragon came.<br>&nbsp;<br>She was never quite sure whether it was the cold that brought the ice dragon or the ice dragon that brought the cold. That was the sort of question that often troubled her brother Geoff, who was two years older than her and insatiably curious, but Adara did not care about such things. So long as the cold and the snow and the ice dragon all arrived on schedule, she was happy.<br>&nbsp;<br>She always knew when they were due because of her birthday. Adara was a winter child, born during the worst freeze that anyone could remember, even Old Laura, who lived on the next farm and remembered things that had happened before anyone else was born. People still talked about that freeze. Adara often heard them.<br>&nbsp;<br>They talked about other things as well. They said it was the chill of that terrible freeze that had killed her mother, stealing in during her long night of labor past the great fire that Adara&#x2019;s father had built, and creeping under the layers of blankets that covered the birthing bed. And they said that the cold had entered Adara in the womb, that her skin had been pale blue and icy to the touch when she came forth, and that she had never warmed in all the years since. The winter had touched her, left its mark upon her, and made her its own.<br>&nbsp;<br>It was true that Adara was always a child apart. She was a very serious little girl who seldom cared to play with the others. She was beautiful, people said, but in a strange, distant sort of way, with her pale skin and blond hair and wide clear blue eyes. She smiled, but not often. No one had ever seen her cry. Once when she was five she had stepped upon a nail imbedded in a board that lay concealed beneath a snowbank, and it had gone clear through her foot, but Adara had not wept or screamed even then. She had pulled her foot loose and walked back to the house, leaving a trail of blood in the snow, and when she had gotten there she had said only, &#x201c;Father, I hurt myself.&#x201d; The sulks and tempers and tears of ordinary childhood were not for her.<br>&nbsp;<br>Even her family knew that Adara was different. Her father was a huge, gruff bear of a man who had little use for people in general, but a smile always broke across his face when Geoff pestered him with questions, and he was full of hugs and laughter for Teri, Adara&#x2019;s older sister, who was golden and freckled, and flirted shamelessly with all the local boys. Every so often he would hug Adara as well, but only during the long winters. But there would be no smiles then. He would only wrap his arms around her, and pull her small body tight against him with all his massive strength, sob deep in his chest, and fat wet tears would run down his ruddy cheeks. He never hugged her at all during the summers. During the summers he was too busy.<br>&nbsp;<br>Everyone was busy during the summers except for Adara. Geoff would work with his father in the fields and ask endless questions about this and that, learning everything a farmer had to know. When he was not working he would run with his friends to the river, and have adventures. Teri ran the house and did the cooking, and worked a bit at the inn by the crossroads during the busy season. The innkeeper&#x2019;s daughter was her friend, and his youngest son was more than a friend, and she would always come back giggly and full of gossip and news from travelers and soldiers and king&#x2019;s messengers. For Teri and Geoff the summers were the best time, and both of them were too busy for Adara.<br>&nbsp;<br>Their father was the busiest of all. A thousand things needed to be done each day, and he did them, and found a thousand more. He worked from dawn to dusk. His muscles grew hard and lean in summer, and he stank from sweat each night when he came in from the fields, but he always came in smiling. After supper he would sit with Geoff and tell him stories and answer his questions, or teach Teri things she did not know about cooking, or stroll down to the inn. He was a summer man, truly.<br>&nbsp;<br>He never drank in summer, except for a cup of wine now and again to celebrate his brother&#x2019;s visits.<br>&nbsp;<br>That was another reason why Teri and Geoff loved the summers, when the world was green and hot and bursting with life. It was only in summer that Uncle Hal, their father&#x2019;s younger brother, came to call. Hal was a dragonrider in service to the king, a tall slender man with a face like a noble. Dragons cannot stand the cold, so when winter fell Hal and his wing would fly south. But each summer he returned, brilliant in the king&#x2019;s green-and-gold uniform, en route to the battlegrounds to the north and west of them. The war had been going on for all of Adara&#x2019;s life.<br>&nbsp;<br>Whenever Hal came north, he would bring presents; toys from the king&#x2019;s city, crystal and gold jewelry, candies, and always a bottle of some expensive wine that he and his brother could share. He would grin at Teri and make her blush with his compliments, and entertain Geoff with tales of war and castles and dragons. As for Adara, he often tried to coax a smile out of her, with gifts and jests and hugs. He seldom succeeded.<br>&nbsp;<br>For all his good nature, Adara did not like Hal; when Hal was there, it meant that winter was far away.<br>&nbsp;<br>Besides, there had been a night when she was only four, and they thought her long asleep, that she overheard them talking over wine. &#x201c;A solemn little thing,&#x201d; Hal said. &#x201c;You ought to be kinder to her, John. You cannot blame her for what happened.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t I?&#x201d; her father replied, his voice thick with wine. &#x201c;No, I suppose not. But it is hard. She looks like Beth, but she has none of Beth&#x2019;s warmth. The winter is in her, you know. Whenever I touch her I feel the chill, and I remember that it was for her that Beth had to die.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You are cold to her.

But she has never loved back. There is nothing in her for me, or you, any of us. She is such a cold little girl.&#x201d; And then he had begun to weep, even though it was summer and Hal was with him.

Debate is the investigative technique used in Tibetan education to sharpen analytical capacities and convey philosophical concepts, so it is essential to master its procedure. Using a debate manual by Pur-bu-jok Jam-ba-gya-tso (1825&#x2013;1901) as his basis, Daniel Perdue covers elementary debate and demonstrates its application to a variety of secular and religious educational contexts. <br><br>The translation is supplied with annotations on procedure and content drawn from Tibetan teachers expert in debate.</p><p>Daniel Perdue (1950&#x2013;2013) was a 1983 graduate of the University of Virginia&#x2019;s prestigious PhD program in Buddhist Studies, where he studied basic debate procedures under Lati Rinpoche, Denma Loch� Rinpoche, and Kensur Yeshi Thupten. Perdue followed up on his study of Buddhist debate in America with travel to Geshe Rabten&#x2019;s Tharpa Choeling Monastery in Switzerland and the four main Ge-luk-ba monasteries reestablished in India. Subsequently, he wrote a dissertation on Tibetan Buddhist debate with thesis director Professor Jeffrey Hopkins. After graduating, he furthered his understanding of Buddhist debate with nearly three years of additional research with Tibetan scholars exiled in India. Perdue has taught the procedures and topics of Buddhist debate at numerous colleges, including Antioch University&#x2019;s program in Buddhist Studies in Bodh Gaya, India; Virginia Tech; North Carolina State University; Sweet Briar College; Washington and Lee University; the College of William and Mary; James Madison University; and Virginia Commonwealth University; as well as at Buddhist centers in America and Europe.

Kyle Hansen, her fianc�, was driving, and his daughter, Rowen, was in the back seat. They were headed up the long, curved driveway to the McAllister mansion, the huge home plated in white marble that overlooked the town of Mill River, Vermont. The trees alongside the driveway were in peak autumn color, and the leaves that floated down as they passed carpeted the pavement in a brilliant mosaic of red, orange, and gold. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s so beautiful,&#x201d; Claudia said. &#x201c;It seems almost magical, like the colors are just dripping everywhere.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yep,&#x201d; Kyle said. &#x201c;Definitely one of the best things about living in Vermont.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rowen leaned forward between the two front seats of the truck and grinned. &#x201c;Imagine how it&#x2019;ll be in the winter, when it&#x2019;s time for the wedding! I&#x2019;ll bet there will be lots of snow! And maybe ice will get stuck on all these trees, like crystal.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That would be gorgeous,&#x201d; Claudia said. She glanced down at her left hand, where the diamond in her engagement ring gleamed in the late afternoon sunshine.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;And romantic,&#x201d; Rowen said. &#x201c;Especially with all the Christmas decorations.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve always wanted a holiday wedding,&#x201d; Claudia said. She looked across at Kyle and smiled. &#x201c;And this place is so close to the church, and so beautiful, at least on the outside. It could be the perfect place for the reception.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s nice on the inside, too,&#x201d; Kyle said, &#x201c;but we&#x2019;ll have to see what Ruth&#x2019;s plans are. It may not even be ready by December.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kyle pulled up to the large paved area in back of the marble house. Ruth Fitzgerald&#x2019;s Buick sedan was already there, parked next to an older Subaru Impreza. As he cut the engine, the back door opened. Ruth appeared and waved them inside. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Hi there,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been waiting for you.&nbsp; Would you believe the kitchen is almost finished? Come in and take a look!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rowen skipped ahead, quickly darting past Ruth into the house. Claudia smiled at Ruth and took Kyle&#x2019;s hand as they walked toward the door.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The back door of the house opened into a small mudroom.&nbsp; From there, Ruth led them into a wide, sunny kitchen. Claudia smelled paint and wood and window cleaner. In fact, a bottle of Windex and several rags rested on the counter. She and Kyle were silent for a moment as they looked around the room. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Directly in front of them, a large, professional stainless steel range gleamed. It was nestled between dark cherry cabinets that ran the length of the wall and continued around the kitchen. Other new appliances interrupted the cherry &#x2013; there were a full-sized refrigerator and freezer, two dishwashers, and a small wine storage unit.&nbsp; The tile backsplash behind the range complimented the rich pattern of the floor tiles. Veins of brown and gold in the new quartz countertops sparkled in the sunlight streaming through the window. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Oh, Ruth, it&#x2019;s beautiful,&#x201d; Claudia breathed. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It is,&#x201d; Ruth agreed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s almost too pretty to cook in. Emily DiSanti&#x2019;s managing the renovation. She&#x2019;s done an amazing job so far.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As if on cue, a striking woman with red hair entered the kitchen. She held a plastic shopping bag.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Ruth, I&#x2019;ve got the hardware for the cabinets, and I&#x2014;oh, hello.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You all know each other, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; Ruth asked.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Oh, sure, of course,&#x201d; Emily said.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s nice to see you again, Emily,&#x201d; Claudia added.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know if you&#x2019;ve heard, but Kyle and Claudia are getting married,&#x201d; Ruth said. The smiling, grandmotherly lady seemed to puff up with scarcely contained happiness. Claudia couldn&#x2019;t help but smile along with her. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes, I heard,&#x201d; Emily said. &#x201c;You know how fast news travels in Mill River. But, congratulations! You must be so excited.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to be the flower girl,&#x201d; Rowen chimed in, hugging Claudia around the waist. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;And you will be perfect, my dear,&#x201d; Ruth told her. &#x201c;But, Emily, I&#x2019;m glad you&#x2019;re here. Kyle and Claudia are planning a holiday wedding, and they were wondering whether the bed and breakfast will be open by then.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;We were hoping our immediate families and maybe the wedding party could stay here,&#x201d; Kyle said. &#x201c;Since we&#x2019;ll be married at St. John&#x2019;s, it would be so convenient.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I told them that the center hall in there would be a lovely place for a reception, too,&#x201d; Ruth said as she looked over Emily&#x2019;s shoulder toward the rest of the house. &#x201c;But I said we&#x2019;d have to ask you about it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emily set the bag she was holding on the floor and took a deep breath. &#x201c;Well, if everything goes according to plan, we&#x2019;ll probably be finished in time. We&#x2019;ve already taken care of most of the big things that needed to be done &#x2013; the electricity upgrade, the new boiler for the radiators, the replacement windows. The drywall crew should be done replacing walls this week, too.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Why did you need to replace walls?&#x201d; Claudia asked.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Mainly because lots of them were plaster and cracking beyond repair. Painted drywall is much easier to maintain. Plus, since it&#x2019;s an older property, covering plaster walls and replacing windows take care of lead paint hazards.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;And my beautiful new kitchen is done,&#x201d; Ruth added with a gleeful look around the room.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes.&nbsp; The owner&#x2019;s suite is coming along nicely, too. Other than that and a few plumbing upgrades, there will be only cosmetic work to do.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;How many rooms will you have?&#x201d; Claudia asked.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Bedrooms, you mean?&#x201d; Ruth asked. &#x201c;Six, not including the owner&#x2019;s suite. And each one has its own bathroom.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That&#x2019;s exactly how many we&#x2019;ll need,&#x201d; Claudia said as she looked up at Kyle. &#x201c;Two for your parents and brother, two for my family, and one apiece for the other groomsmen and bridesmaids.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;And where would you two stay?&#x201d; Ruth asked with a mischievous puckered smile. &#x201c;Surely you wouldn&#x2019;t spend your wedding night at home.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Well, I think--&#x201d; Claudia began, but Kyle interrupted her.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Oh, no,&#x201d; he said quickly, and Claudia turned to look at him again. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be out of here that evening. We&#x2019;re not leaving for the honeymoon until after Christmas, of course, but I&#x2019;ve got something in mind for our first night as a married couple.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t say anything to me about that,&#x201d; Claudia said in a mock protest. She poked him gently in the ribs. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Of course I didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d; He grabbed her hand to protect against further jabs. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Where are we going?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kyle smiled but didn&#x2019;t answer her. Instead, he spoke to Ruth. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;So, what do you think about us maybe being your first customers?" <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It would be an honor to host your families and your reception,&#x201d; Ruth said. &#x201c;Oh, I can&#x2019;t wait to show you the whole house! You&#x2019;ll be able to see how perfect everything will be. That is, if we can be ready. Emily, are you sure we can commit to it?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Claudia watched, a fleeting look of concern passed over Emily&#x2019;s face. It was gone in an instant, though, replaced with a wide smile.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Absolutely. It&#x2019;ll be close, but I&#x2019;ll make it happen.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~~~~<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the master bedroom on the second floor of the marble mansion, Emily turned off the edge sander she had been using and shifted into a sitting position on the floor. Without the noise of the machine, she could hear Ruth chatting with Kyle, Claudia, and Rowen on their way out. She tried to ignore the stress that had been building after she&#x2019;d agreed to have the house ready in time for Kyle and Claudia&#x2019;s wedding.&nbsp; True, she had plenty of experience working to meet deadlines, and she had brought enough old houses back to their original grandeur to know what remained to be done in the McAllister mansion, but it wouldn&#x2019;t be easy. Between her part-time job at Turner&#x2019;s Hardware and the odd jobs she did on the side for her mother&#x2019;s real estate listings, she wouldn&#x2019;t have a spare minute for the next two months.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emily sighed and got back on her hands and knees. Using the small handheld sander to remove the final bits of old finish on a wood floor was her least favorite part of the refinishing process. She took some comfort in knowing that this was the last room she had to do, though. She had finished resurfacing the wood floors on the lower level during the summer, and the floors in many of the other bedrooms upstairs needed nothing but a good mopping and waxing, since the rooms had never been used. Emily continued working her way around the room, crawling along the windows and into the closet. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was then that she felt the crack in the floor beneath her hand.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She switched off the sander. The crack seemed to run perpendicular to the planks of the wood floor, and her first thought was that she might have to completely replace several of the pieces of wood instead of refinishing them. When she looked closely, though, she saw that the crack wasn&#x2019;t a crack at all, but one side of a well-camouflaged rectangle that had been cut into the floor.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, it looked like some sort of trap door.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Emily?&#x201d; Ruth&#x2019;s voice called, and the sound of footsteps on the stairs followed soon after.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;In here,&#x201d; she replied. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ruth entered the room slightly out of breath. &#x201c;Goodness, I don&#x2019;t know if I&#x2019;ll ever get used to such a big staircase.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;A big staircase for a big house.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes. I guess I&#x2019;m ready to head home. I just wanted to check to see if you needed anything.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m good,&#x201d; Emily said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to leave, too, as soon as I&#x2019;m done edging in here.&nbsp; I&#x2019;ll vacuum first thing in the morning and then get going on the stain. I&#x2019;ll lock up everything, as usual.&#x201d; Her hand was still resting on the floor, and she felt the crack she had discovered leaving an indentation on her palm.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Thanks, honey. You have a good night.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once Ruth had left the house, Emily jumped up. Her toolbox was on the floor near the base of the stairs, and she descended quickly to grab one of her putty knives and a flashlight. Then, back in the master bedroom, she entered the closet and knelt down. The thin blade of the putty knife just fit into the crack. It was difficult, but she was able to pry up a chunk of the floor, a rectangular lid, which she set aside. She switched on her flashlight and peered down into a hidden compartment. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The space was perhaps two feet deep. The only thing inside, other than dust and cobwebs, was an old hard side briefcase.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emily took hold of the dusty handle and pulled it out. The case was made of smooth, tan leather. Unlike most modern cases, which used combination locks, the brass locks on each side of the handle had keyholes. To her chagrin, the locks were engaged. &nbsp;She shook the briefcase gently. It wasn&#x2019;t heavy, but a soft rustling noise from inside told her that it wasn&#x2019;t empty, either.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Maybe the key to the briefcase was still in the compartment. </i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, she took the flashlight and shined it down into the hole. She was more careful this time, moving the light slowly and running her fingers through the dust at the bottom of the compartment in the hope of finding a wayward key. She found nothing, though, and the disturbed dust rose up in a cloud that sent her into a sneezing fit. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When she had recovered, she took another good look at her find. A small bronze plaque attached to one corner of the case was engraved with &#x201c;P. McAllister.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The briefcase was obviously something that had belonged to a member of the McAllister family, and eventually Mary McAllister herself. Which meant that now, like everything in the McAllister mansion, it was the property of Ruth and her husband. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>I can drop it off at the Fitzgeralds&#x2019; apartment on the way home</i>, Emily thought, but telling herself this did nothing to lessen her intense curiosity about what was inside the old briefcase. Surely, she could find a way to open it without breaking the locks. The case was in remarkable condition and probably valuable as an antique.&nbsp; Plus, she reasoned, it would be a favor to Ruth, since she and her husband would be able to inspect its contents easily.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Of course, if I open it, I&#x2019;ll be able to see what's in it, too.</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A part of her was ashamed at her willingness to justify and commit such an inappropriate invasion of privacy.&nbsp; Still, that part wasn&#x2019;t strong enough to prevent her from going back to her toolbox in search of a small screwdriver or a long nail &#x2013; or anything else that might help her coax the locks on the briefcase into revealing what was inside.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~~~~<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the afternoon gave way to a chilly evening, Father O&#x2019;Brien drove carefully down the main road leaving Mill River.&nbsp; However, instead of following the curve of the road around and through the old covered bridge spanning the river for which the town was named, he turned left into a driveway and parked. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As he had recently ...</p><h2>At Home: The Domestic Interior in Art</h2><p><b>Paintings by more than 100 artists from the past four centuries celebrate the home and domestic life.</b><br><br>No genre in the history of art has such immediate, and such lasting, popular appeal as the domestic interior, shown here in more than 150 paintings. And yet behind these evocative scenes lies an important reassessment. The domestic interior has had a hidden life in the history of art, and Frances Borzello, in a delightfully written text, shows why it has misleadingly been neglected as a category in art.<br><br>The story starts with the interiors of the Dutch artists of the seventeenth century and takes in a long period in which the interior was frowned upon or ignored by the rules of artistic propriety. During the nineteenth century social and economic change encouraged new concentration on depicting the home environment, culminating in the interior's greatest golden age in the late nineteenth century. The evolution of the genre in our own time challenges conventional wisdom that domesticity was the enemy of the avant-garde.<br><br>The book includes reproductions of ravishing works by more than 100 artists, from Maes and Vermeer to Sargent, Bonnard, and Cassatt to Hopper and Tanning. 160 color illustrations.</p><p><b>Frances Borzello</b> is the author of <i>Seeing Ourselves: Women's Self-Portraits</i> and <i>A World of Our Own</i>.

This collection of Tony&#39;s wide-ranging commentary covers everything from dieting to bread, from gourmet coffee to Bill Clinton to the sporting world.</p><p><i>Washington Post</i> humor columnist Tony Kornheiser takes on the big issues of the day: how cigarette makers are targeting what they call "Virile Females," the death of Orlon (and its partner Ban-Lon), coffins you can use as furniture before you put them to their final use, and a really weird kid in Japan who injected his scalp with silicone to meet the height requirement for Sumo wrestling.Washington Post syndicated columnist Kornheiser here collects his columns of the past eight years; the best entries are very funny, and the weakest are dull. He puts his worst foot forward with a leaden introduction and the labored piece from which he took the book's title. He then proceeds to such topics as kids, the vicissitudes of contemporary life, flying, driving, scandals in the news, women ogling men and family problems. Well worth the price of admission are his essays on the "Life Coffin," an article that can be used as a living-room bookcase until it is needed for other purposes; a class for fearful airplane passengers, in which confessions by fellow students gave Kornheiser reasons for apprehension he had never thought of before; trendy new coffee bars with coffees that are far beyond the exotic. Fans will enjoy finding out that the Polish alphabet "consists of only seven letters?Z, X, I, Y, K, C and S," and why Kornheiser, in rejecting trendy foods, came to bury fennel not to braise it. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Race, Evolution, and Behavior: A Life History Perspective (3rd Edition)</h2><p>Using evidence from psychology, anthropology, sociology and other scientific disciplines, this book shows that there are at least three biological races (subspecies) of man Orientals (i.e., Mongoloids or Asians), Blacks (i.e., Negroids or Africans), and Whites (i.e., Caucasoids or Europeans). There are recognizable profiles for the three major racial groups on brain size, intelligence, personality and temperament, sexual behavior, and rates of fertility, maturation and longevity. The profiles reveal that, ON AVERAGE, Orientals and their descendants around the world fall at one end of the continuum, Blacks and their descendants around the world fall at the other end of the continuum, Europeans regularly fall in between. This worldwide pattern implies evolutionary and genetic, rather than purely social, political, economic, or cultural causes.</p><p>J.

From these basics, they sought to understand the essential ingredients of the world. Those who could see further, those who understood that the four were just the beginning, were the last sorcerers �&#x20ac;" and the world�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s first chemists.</p> <p>What we now call chemistry began in the fiery cauldrons of mystics and sorcerers seeking not to make a better world through science, but rather to make themselves richer through magic formulas and con games. But among these early magicians, frauds, and con artists were a few far-seeing �&#x20ac;&#x153;alchemists�&#x20ac; who, through rigorous experimentation, transformed mysticism into science.</p> <p>By the 18th century the building blocks of nature, the elements of which all matter is composed, were on the verge of being discovery. Initially, it was not easy to determine whether a substance really was an element. Was water just water, plain and simple? Or could it be the sum of other (unknown and maybe unknowable) parts? And if water was made up of other substances, how could it be broken down into discreet, fundamental, and measurable components?</p> <p>Scientific historians generally credit the great 18th century French chemist Antoine Lavoisier with addressing these fundamental questions and ultimately modernizing the field of chemistry. Through his meticulous and precise work this chaotic new field of scientific inquiry was given order. Exacting by nature, Lavoisier painstakingly set about performing experiments that would provide lasting and verifiable proofs of various chemical theories. Unfortunately, the outspoken Lavoisier eventually lost his head in the Terror, but others would follow his lead, carefully examining, measuring, and recording their findings.</p> <p>As the field slowly progressed, another pioneer was to emerged almost 100 years later. Dimitri Mendeleev, an eccentric genius who cut his flowing hair and beard but once a year, sought to answer the most pressing questions that remained to chemists: Why did some elements have properties that resembled those of others? Were there certain natural groups of elements? And, if so, how many, and what elements fit into them? It was Mendeleev who finally addressed all these issues when he constructed the first Periodic Table in the late 1800s.</p> <p>But between and after Lavoisier and Mendeleev were a host of other colorful, brilliant scientists who made their mark on the field of chemistry. Depicting the lively careers of these scientists and their contributions while carefully deconstructing the history and the science, author Richard Morris skillfully brings it all to life. Hailed by Kirkus Reviews as a �&#x20ac;&#x153;clear and lively writer with a penchant for down-to-earth examples�&#x20ac; Morris�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s gift for explanation �&#x20ac;" and pure entertainment �&#x20ac;" is abundantly obvious. Taking a cue from the great chemists themselves, Morris has brewed up a potent combination of the alluringly obscure and the historically momentous, spiked with just the right dose of quirky and ribald detail to deliver a magical brew of history, science, and personalities.</p> Table of Contents<br><ul><li>Front Matter</li><li>1.

Erudite and entertaining, I enjoyed every page." <br>-- Michael White, co-author of Stephen Hawking: A Life in Science </p><p>"An intriguing look at the development of the chemical knowledge of atoms and elements which parallels the even more astonishing discoveries of recent years -- by physicists -- of the world within the atom. Interesting, informative and eminently readable." <br>-- Penny Le Couteur, author of Napoleon's Buttons: How Seventeen Molecules Changed History </p><p>"The struggle to understand the material world started with the ancient Greeks, who believed everything consisted of earth, air, fire, and water, and ended 2500 years later with the discovery of the chemical elements, the periodic table, and the structure of atoms. Along the way those shadowy figures, the much misunderstood alchemists of the Middle Ages, struggled with the problem, but with little success. Morris tells all these stories in a well-researched book that is both informative and a delight to read, with lots of amusing and dramatic anecdotes about those who finally brought us to our present state of knowledge." <br>-- John Emsley, author of The 13th Element: The Sordid Tale of Murder, Fire, and Phosphorus and Molecules at an Exhibition </p><p>"It's our journey from magic to molecules.

Although these conditions have reached epidemic proportions, treatment has been limited to ineffective behavioral therapies or the controversial prescription drug Ritalin. Now Dr. B. Jacqueline Stordy, a leading researcher in the field, reveals a stunning new treatment based on a simple nutritional supplement: LCP (long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids). The LCP Solution is the first book to describe this new natural treatment and to explain how children (and adults) can incorporate it into their daily lives.<br><br>As a member of a family with a long history of dyslexia, Dr. Stordy discovered in a pioneering experiment that dyslexic and dyspraxic children who began taking a dietary supplement consisting of LCP experienced dramatic transformations in the quality of their lives. At the same time, parallel studies conducted at Purdue University came up with similar results with children who had ADHD. The effect of this dietary supplement was nothing short of revolutionary: after only a few weeks, dyslexic and ADHD children became calmer, more focused, easier to teach, while dyspraxics improved significantly in dexterity and balance, showing markedly less anxiety.<br><br>In The LCP Solution, Dr. Stordy documents how this life-changing treatment came about and explains step-by-step how sufferers of each of the three major conditions can use it to change their lives at home, at school, and at work. Illuminating, vividly presented, and authoritative in its findings, this book will revolutionize our approach to learning disabilities. LCPs are natural, simple to use, and amazing in their benefits. If you or someone you love suffers from a learning disability, this book is essential reading.</p><p>"This book is must reading not only for those suffering from ADHD and related disorders, but also for everyone interested in optimal brain health at any age."<br>--CHRISTIANE NORTHRUP, M.D.<br> Author of Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom<br><b>B.

So he did everything he could to avoid it&#x2014;he'd play his flute, challenge a friend to chess, or tease his cat. But when he did write, he produced work in a wide variety of genres: mystery, science fiction, black comedy, sometimes all in the same work. His first science fiction story, &#x201c;Not Yet the End,&#x201d; was published in 1941, and one of his stories, &#x201c;Arena,&#x201d; was adapted as an episode of Star Trek. The Fabulous Clipjoint, Brown&#x2019;s first mystery novel, won the Edgar Award for outstanding first mystery and began a series featuring Ed and Ambrose Hunter, carny-relatives turned detectives. Brown was a newspaperman by trade, married twice with two sons, who devoted all-to-little of his life to fulltime writing. He died on March 11, 1972 in Tucson at age 65 from emphysema.<p>"<em>Madball</em> is a terrific pulp novel that is filled with energy and excitement from cover to cover...Brown fills this novel with all manner of thieves, murderers, strippers, carnival barkers, knife throwers, drifters, fortune tellers, and others... all linked together by stolen money, jealousy, fear, lust, and greed."--Dave Wilde</p><p>"Perhaps his best mystery novel."--Frank McSherry</p><p>"This novel is deliciously dark, suspenseful, slightly comedic and ribald... be sure not to miss this one--Mr. Brown will charm you and hold you in uneasy rapt attention."--Michael Schramm</p></p><h2>Messiah-the Greatest Sermon Ever Sung</h2><p>Written by Pastor Tony Pittenger and illustrated by Jonathan Mayer, Messiah-the Greatest Sermon Ever Sung is a running commentary for G.F.

There are 290 black-and-white photographs and 20 color photos from the years during the operation of the concentration camp (the largest extermination center for European Jews) and from the period immediately following the camp's liberation in 1945. The best-known SS photos are those taken in 1944 of the Jews from Hungary (an album containing the photos was found accidentally by a Slovak Jew). Some photos were taken illegally by people from secret organizations, aerial photos were taken by Allied planes, some photos were taken by film operators of the liberating Soviet army, and others were taken by a soldier of the Polish army and by a Polish Red Cross worker. There are photos of the gas chambers, of Jews being herded off trains, of women prisoners with shaved heads, of prisoners at work, of women and children who had undergone medical experiments, of carts loaded with bodies, of Jews being led to the gas chambers, and of human remains in the crematoriums. There is also a section of pictures and drawings by prisoners, chronicling the cruelty and inhumanity in the camp. Horrifying and distressing, to be sure; but in this age of Holocaust denial, here is undeniable visual evidence of the macabre truth. <i>George Cohen</i></p><h2>The Tippling Bros.

They came and took what they saw.<br><br>The Esker sisters are shoppers. Loving, caring, driven, merciless shoppers. Ida never "passes a store without slipping in and buying something to give away." Pola, who only buys in bulk, would have been good in foreign affairs: "If a nation acted up, Aunt Pola would buy it." And Hedy, dearest of them all, proved the whole thing was genetic. Or maybe environmental. Either way, she passed the bug of galloping consumption onto her son.<br><br>Her son is Joe Reckler. Twenty-six. Yale grad. No job. No ties. Nothing to keep him from joining Mother and the aunts on a week-long shopping extravaganza disguised as a New England Autumn Leaves Tour that takes them everywhere from Bloomingdale's to L. L. Bean. But soon Joe notices a difference between himself and his mega-shopping mentors. You see, he figures you're supposed to pay.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p><p>"Flat out hilarious ... Sort of like what I imagine P.G. Wodehouse would have written after spending some time in Bloomingdale's ... For sheer enjoyment, this book is a bargain. Buy two. You can freeze one. You never know." Jeff Danzinger, The Boston Globe</p>From the double-edged title to its last line, Rudnick's new novel spotlights its author's comic gifts even more vividly than did his hilarious, cartoonish debut, Social Disease. Turning his attention from brainless club-hopping WASPs to a nice Jewish family from New York whose members have an unusual fondness for shopping, Rudnick uses his wicked ear for dialogue and sure sense of caricature to sustain a vengefully funny and deeply affectionate portrait. Hedy Reckler and her older sisters Ida and Pola have worked hard to pamper their husbands and children; now, with Hedy's layabout son Joe, they plan a small reward: a week-long trip through New England, ostensibly to see the autumn leaves, but actually a barely veiled excuse for a multi-state shopping spree. For all four, shopping is a spiritual, emotional and close to carnal pleasure, but unlike her sisters, Hedy doesn't always understand the phrase "I'll take it" to involve payment. Rudnick writes about shopping with the passion a master chef would bring to describing the perfect truffle, and some of his comic set-pieces provoke helpless laughter, but the heart of the novel is his depiction of Ida, Pola and Hedy: quarrelsome, nostalgic and completely true to life. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Malina (Penguin Modern Classics)</h2><p><p>Here is the story of lives painfully intertwined. </p><p>An unnamed narrator is haunted by nightmarish memories of her father and desperate for the attentions of her lover.

As new technologies and arrangements of public and private space changed the ways people experienced time and space, the urban panorama became less coherent&#x2014;a metropolis defying traditional representation and definition, a vast jumble of shifting fragments and glimpses&#x2014;and writers were compelled to create new methods for conveying the experience of the city.In a series of subtle and convincing interpretations of novels by Flaubert, Dickens, Bely, Woolf, Joyce, and Kafka, Alter reveals the ways the city entered the literary imagination. He shows how writers of diverse imaginative temperaments developed innovative techniques to represent shifts in modern consciousness. Writers sought more than a journalistic representation of city living, he argues, and to convey meaningfully the reality of the metropolis, the city had to be re-created or reimagined. His book probes the literary response to changing realities of the period and contributes significantly to our understanding of the history of the Western imagination.</p><p>One of our most respected literary critics investigates the ways that runaway growth of urban centers in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries irrevocably altered the Western imagination.

Sarris (English/UCLA; Keeping Slug Woman Alive, not reviewed) offers 10 linked short stories describing the milieu of the Pomo Indians (from whom he is descended) in the small coastal California town of Santa Rosa (Sarris himself is chairman of the Coastal Miwok tribe). Though the people described no longer live on the reservation, they still live together, congregated in a collection of old WW IIera barracks in an Indian ghetto around the street of the title. All of the nine narrators (two stories are told by the same teller) are related, part of the family of Juana Maria. Some are young; others are old and near death. All experience poverty and dislocation. The majority are strong-voiced women. A girl tells the story of how her unbalanced cousin Ruby struggled valiantly but hopelessly to save a crippled pony from the slaughterhouse. A mother watches her daughter wither away under the onslaught of leukemia. A daughter reminisces about her mother, who worked as a maid for a well-to-do white family and longed for acceptance by her own family. The importance of family and acceptance lie at the heart of many of the stories. A father writes secret letters to the son he never knew he had. An old woman clings to a newfound relationship with the granddaughter of a family member she thinks she let down, and as she does, the innocence of youth chips away at the jadedness of age. The story cycle as a whole follows a subtle trajectory: It begins with hatred, rejection, and despair and ends with hope and belonging. Often, however, there is one step backward for every two steps forward. Sarris sets himself a difficult task and accomplishes it well. Without being mawkish or sentimental, he creates a variety of voices--male and female--who tell the struggles of a people and their determination to survive.

In The Life of the Cosmos, Smolin cuts the Gordian knot of cosmology with a simple, powerful idea: &#34;The underlying structure of our world, &#34; he writes, &#34;is to be found in the logic of evolution.&#34; Today&#39;s physicists have overturned Newton&#39;s view of the universe, yet they continue to cling to an understanding of reality not unlike Newton&#39;s own - as a clock, an intricate mechanism, governed by laws which are mathematical and eternally true. Smolin argues that the laws of nature we observe may be in part the result of a process of natural selection which took place before the big bang. Smolin&#39;s ideas are based on recent developments in cosmology, quantum theory, relativity and string theory, yet they offer, at the same time, an unprecedented view of how these developments may fit together to form a new theory of cosmology. From this perspective, the lines between the simple and the complex, the fundamental and the emergent, and even between the biological and the physical are redrawn. The result is a framework that illuminates many intractable problems, from the paradoxes of quantum theory and the nature of space and time to the problem of constructing a final theory of physics. As he argues for this new view, Smolin introduces the reader to recent developments in a wide range of fields, from string theory and quantum gravity to evolutionary theory the structure of galaxies. He examines the philosophical roots of controversies in the foundations of physics, and shows how they may be transformed as science moves towardunderstanding the universe as an interrelated, self-constructed entity, within which life and complexity have a natural place, and in which &#34;the occurrence of novelty, indeed the perpetual birth of novelty, can be understood.&#34;</p><p>Lee Smolin is not afraid to think big--really, really big. His theory of cosmic evolution by the natural selection of black-hole universes makes what we can experience into an infinitesimal, yet crucial, part of an ever-larger whole. Smolin says, &#34;the new view of the universe is light, in all its senses, because what Darwin has given us, and what we may aspire to generalize to the cosmos as a whole, is a way of thinking about the world which is scientific and mechanistic, but in which the occurrence of novelty--indeed, the perpetual birth of novelty--can be understood.&#34; Other scientists are, to say the least, divided on whether Smolin has much chance of being right, but they agree with Paul Davies that he is &#34;a deep and original thinker.&#34;<br><strong>Lee Smolin</strong> is Professor of Physics at the Center for Gravitational Physics and Geometry at the Pennsylvania State University. As a theoretical physicist, he has contributed several key ideas to the search for a unification of quantum theory, cosmology, and relativity.<br></p><h2>Go Hang a Salami!

Wahl takes an in-depth look a how unfavorable public images of mental illness are often inaccurate. Statistics show that one out of every five people in the U.S. will experience a psychiatric illness. With boldness and sensitivity, Wahl takes a powerful look at the inaccurate stereotypes created by the media.&#34;</p><p>From Psycho, Silence of the Lambs, Kojak, and Melrose Place, from books, music, cartoons, advertising, and newspapers, we all derive our images of mental illness. These omnipresent media portrayals are at the least insensitive, inaccurate, and unfavorable and at the worst stigmatizing and pernicious. In this important book, Dr. Otto Wahl examines the prevalence, nature, and impact of such depictions, using numerous examples from film, television, and print media. He documents the remarkable frequency of these images and demonstrates how the media has stereotyped the mentally ill through exaggeration, misunderstanding, ridicule, and disrespect. Media Madness also shows the damaging consequences of such stereotypes - stigma, rejection, loss of self-esteem, reluctance to seek, accept, or reveal psychiatric treatment, discrimination, and restriction of opportunity. The forces that shape current images of mental illness are clarified, as are the efforts of organizations and individuals to combat such exploitation.</p><h2>Montana Breed</h2><p>After the death of his father, nineteen-year-old Rafe Gunn uses his inheritance to seek out his mother&#39;s people, the Oglala Sioux, but he soon discovers that the lawlessness of the frontier threatens his quest.

He has won numerous awards for his journalism, including a National Magazine Award for feature writing.Former Washington Post staffer Brown (Afterwards, You're a Genius) offers a vibrant portrait of multitalented, enigmatic outdoorsman Guy Waterman, whose son Jon's climbing-related death was chronicled in Jon Krakauer's Into the Wild. Beneath a title borrowed from Emily Dickinson, a ghostly mountaineer cover photo evokes events leading to the 67-year-old's carefully planned, snowy, subzero suicide in February 2000. Opening with the retrieval of Waterman's body from New Hampshire's Franconia Ridge, Brown traces Waterman's life and career. Inspired by Helen and Scott Nearing's back-to-the-land bible, Living the Good Life, Guy and Laura Waterman left New York City in 1973 to live off the land in Vermont. The conservationist couple collaborated on adventure-type magazine pieces and books and found an intimacy with the earth, but dark clouds of grief over losing his two sons (another son, Bill, died in a mountaineering accident, too) hovered. By 1992, Waterman saw suicide as a sensible option and wrote, I'm prepared to accept sixty years as a sufficient lifetime; and my intermittent glories as a piano player, politician, father, homesteader, and mountain environmental advocate and activist as concluded. His final message read, Do not take special efforts to save life. Death is intended. Mapping an existential journey through life and death, Brown has blazed a poetic path into Waterman's soul.

Yet each of these individuals had an identity and role in the New Testament world far broader than her link with Paul. This book is a series of sketches which brings these women out of Paul&#39;s shadow and on to center stage. The women are grouped and studied under the following themes: Women in Paul&#39;s Family; Remembered for Their Faith (Lois and Eunice, Damaris); Household Heads (Lydia, Chloe, Nympha); Co Workers with the Apostle (Euodia and Syntyche, Prisca); A Deacon and an Apostle (Phoebe and Junia); Workers in the Lord and Other Church Members (Mary, Tryphaena and Tryphosa, Persis, the Mother of Rufus, Julia and the Sister of Nereus, Claudia, Apphia, the Daughters of Philip, Mary and Rhoda of Jerusalem); Women of the Jewish Aristocracy (Bernice and Drusilla).</p><p></p><h2>Hey, Wait...</h2><p><p><strong>2002 Harvey Award Winner, Best New Talent: this superbly evocative story by the award-winning Norwegian cartoonist is a tale of childhood friendship and tragedy, and the terrible lingering aftereffects thereof.</strong></p> One of Europe's most exciting young cartoonists makes his American debut. This superbly evocative graphic novella by the award-winning Norwegian cartoonist Jason (his first appearance in the English language) starts off as a melancholy childhood memoir and then, with a shocking twist midway through, becomes the summary of lives lived, wasted, and lost. Like Art Spiegelman did with <i>Maus</i>, Jason utilizes anthropomorphic stylizations to reach deeper, more general truths, and to create elegantly minimalist panels whose emotional depth-charge comes as an even greater shock. His sparse dialogue, dark wit, and supremely bold use of "jump-cuts" from one scene to the next (sometimes spanning a number of years) make <i>Hey, Wait...</i> one of the most surprising and engaging debuts of the year.

In Ancel Keys' Seven Countries study (Italy was one of the countries), this diet was associated with lower death rates from heart disease. The diet was popularized in America due to its population's low incidence of disease and long lifespan. Unfortunately, Pioppi and many surrounding areas that originally consumed a peasant fare can no longer afford to do so. Processed food is more readily available and cheaper. These areas, once renowned for their health, have soaring rates of obesity in part due to a current lack of whole grains, fresh fruits, and vegetables from their diets. These items are just too expensive, and they don't taste as good.<br><br>Here's what's in the&nbsp;real&nbsp;Mediterranean diet: high olive oil consumption (mono-unsaturated fat); legumes (beans, lentils, peas); fruits, vegetables, and unrefined grains (fiber); dairy products (saturated fat); eggs (high-quality protein); fish (omega-3s); and wine in moderation (resveratrol, flavonoids, and likely other factors). Americans misunderstand the Mediterranean diet, because they think it is all about pasta, which is Italian but&nbsp;not&nbsp;Mediterranean. Because what the Italians used to eat in Italy is not what the Italians eat in the United States. The pasta and pizza movement actually started in the United States within the poor Italian immigrant population, based on the cost of carbohydrates versus meat. That diet then migrated over to Italy. And now the Italians have our problem.</p><h2>Grits Friends Are Forevah: A Southern-Style Celebration of Women</h2><p>A celebration of the distinctive life and friendships of southern women builds on the success of the award-winning The GRITS Guide to Life and shares tips on how to enhance relationships and an everyday lifestyle with a southern flair. 60,000 first printing.</p><p><p> <b>Debbie Ford</b>was an internationally recognized expert in the field of personal transformation.

Visit: www.DebbieFord.com.</p> <br>Ford's third book devoted to her GRITS (Girls Raised in the South) theory of friendship reads like a sassily rewritten '50s-era catalog of tips for young women that, in keeping with the old-fashioned advice, offers nary a magnolia-scented drop of new insight on friendships. However, Ford presents her time-tested information in a light-hearted manner that will please some female readers. She celebrates women's most rewarding relationships (with a Mom who is "part confessor, part fashion guru, part teacher, part cook, part drill sergeant and part coach"), and offers stale hints on deepening friendships. But readers with modern sensibilities will scoff at Ford's vintage take on friends ("No matter how much a Southern girl looks forward to the day when she gets a pin... from her Southern fraternity man, that moment is not as sweet as the day she gets a bid from her sisters.") and manners ("ladies know that politics doesn't make suitable evening conversation") and her insistence that universal traits-a fondness for family gatherings, for instance-are Southern in origin. Readers who appreciated earlier GRITS volumes may find a few gems in here, though most readers would do well to spend the cover price on a couple of mint juleps.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Awaiting safe passage to New York on the SS <i>Manhattan</i>, two couples meet: Pete and Julia Winters, expatriate Americans fleeing their sedate life in Paris; and Edward and Iris Freleng, sophisticated, independently wealthy, bohemian, and beset by the social and sexual anxieties of their class. As Portugal's neutrality, and the world's future, hang in the balance, the hidden threads in the lives of these four characters-Julia's status as a Jew, Pete and Edward's improbable affair, Iris's increasingly desperate efforts to save her tenuous marriage-begin to come loose. </p><p>Gorgeously written, sexually and politically charged, David Leavitt's long-awaited new novel is an extraordinary work.</p></p><p><p><b>David Leavitt</b>'s books include the collection <i>Family Dancing</i>, and the novels <i>The Lost Language of Cranes</i>, <i>While England Sleeps</i>, <i>The Body of Jonah Boyd</i>, and <i>The Indian Clerk</i> (finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award and the IMPAC Dublin Literary Award).

He is professor of English at the University of Florida in Gainesville and edits the literary magazine<i> Subtropics</i>.<br>www.davidleavittwriter.com</p>*Starred Review* With his first novel, The Lost Language of Cranes (1986), Leavitt claimed attention as a serious fiction writer, and the publication of his first collection of short stories, Family Dancing (1984), a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award, alerted readers that he was to be taken as a talented writer in the short form as well. Leavitt&#x2019;s new novel establishes a brisk pace from page one, corresponding to the jittery atmosphere of the place and time in which it is set: the Portuguese capital of Lisbon, which, in the summer of 1940, is the only neutral port left in Europe. Refugees from the German takeover of most of the continent are gathered in Lisbon awaiting a chance to escape the war&#x2019;s dangers. Leavitt focuses on two married couples as they pass the tense time until an American ship, the Manhattan, will arrive to carry them and other fortunate ticket-holders to the U.S. With one of the men narrating the novel&#x2019;s events, recalling them from the distance of several years, we follow the couples as they wait for relief from the dangers closing in and, in the meantime, play their own game of intrigue, not on an international diplomatic level but on a personal and even more confounding level: the two wives having to deal with an affair that quickly ignites between their husbands. The result is a dramatic story that Leavitt weaves with compelling authority and empathy.

Aside from pictures of Seattle Slew crossing the finish line of the 1977 Kentucky Derby and the 1986 New York Mets exulting after stealing the series from the Boston Red Sox, Riger's black-and-white photographs focus on smaller moments. One memorable shot entitled "Pain" features Mickey Mantle grimacing after a failed swing in the 1961 World Series. Grim determination is evident on the face of young Cassius Clay, the newly crowned heavyweight champion, as he pauses in a 1965 training session. The consummate grace of Celtic great Bill Russell comes through as he extends his body shooting a lay-up in 1964. Featuring an introduction by David Halberstam and an afterword by the photographer, sports fans are sure to enjoy these photographs.

Gildemeister, who&#39;s a founder of the Mediterranean Garden Society and frequent gardening author living in Spain, discusses a wide array of topics, including invasive species, native species, how to maximize the garden&#39;s setting, fruits and vegetables, and labor-saving methods. The volume is well illustrated with color photos. Annotation �2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)</p><p>Heidi Gildemeister, a founding member and former president of the Mediterranean Garden Society, is the author of <i>Mediterranean Gardening: A Waterwise Approach</i> and has contributed to <i>The New Royal Horticulture Society Dictionary of Gardening</i>. She lives in Mallorca, Spain.Mediterranean-climate regions, characterized as "winter-wet and summer-dry" within a narrow set of specialized conditions, make up only a tiny percentage of the Earth's surface, including the Mediterranean basin and small areas of southern Australia, California, central Chile and the Cape of South Africa. The aesthetic, however, is ubiquitous: "all things Mediterranean have become fashionable." Gildemeister, an author, lecturer and founding member and past president of the Mediterranean Garden Society, writes with evident enthusiasm for pursuing that aesthetic in the face of "hot, dry summers and strong light" or "devastating winds, destructive fires, and erosion." Her exuberant text takes readers on a whirlwind tour of "Mediterranean Dream Gardens" from olive groves and sheep parks to city courtyards. Two brief initial chapters cover basic horticultural and design issues specific to this style of gardening. The remainder is devoted to "inspirational garden projects" that tackle a wide range of objectives, sites and challenges. These chapters are well researched, informative and practical, each concluding with a thorough listing of appropriate plants. Unfortunately, the lists themselves aren't illustrated, and almost none of the recommended plants are identified in captions for the 207 lush color photographs. This is doubly frustrating, since Gildemeister tempts readers from all climates with the timeless beauty, environmental prudence and rich history of Mediterranean gardening. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The person who deserved her RESPECT!</p><p>I&#x2019;m honored to have played a part in righting the wrong, in bringing true justice to the woman who, due to the constraints of her job, is unable to mete out justice for herself.</p><p>I will be her avenger, her champion.</p><p>Soon, she&#x2019;ll know there is someone who will stand up for her, do what needs to be done. When she sees my message, she&#x2019;ll know she has someone behind her, who understands, admires, and respects her above all others. As no one ever did for me. Our connection is so strong, so intense, I can often read her thoughts. I wonder if she can read mine.</p><p>Sometimes, late at night, I sense she&#x2019;s with me, right here with me. How else could I have known where to start, and just what to do?</p><p>Ours is a spiritual bond I treasure, something deep and strong, and older than time.

I want the building&#x2019;s security discs, exterior, interior, and I want a canvass started, beginning with this floor.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; He jutted his chin to the writing on the wall. &#x201c;You know the vic?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve had some dealings with her.&#x201d; To discourage any more questions, Eve turned away.</p><p>She and Peabody had sealed up on entering the apartment. She&#x2019;d turned on her recorder before stepping into the bedroom. Now she stood a moment, a tall, slim woman with short, tousled brown hair, with long-lidded eyes of gilded brown cop-flat in her angular face.</p><p>Yeah, they&#x2019;d had some dealings, she thought now, and she hadn&#x2019;t had a modicum of liking for the victim. But it appeared she and Peabody would be spending the last days of the year standing for the once-high-powered defense attorney who&#x2019;d had&#x2014;to Eve&#x2019;s mind&#x2014;the ethics of a rattlesnake.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s verify ID, Peabody, and keep every step of this strict on procedure.&#x201d;</p><p>With a nod, Peabody took off her pink leather coat&#x2014;Eve&#x2019;s Christmas gift&#x2014;set it carefully aside before she pulled her Identi-pad from her field kit. With her striped pink pom-pom hat still over her flip of dark hair, she approached the body. &#x201c;Victim is identified as Leanore Bastwick of this address.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Cause of death looks pretty straightforward. Strangulation, probably a wire garrote, but the ME will confirm. Get time of death.&#x201d;</p><p>Again Peabody dug into her field kit. She worked the gauges, angled, as she read Eve&#x2019;s unspoken order, so the record would pick up everything.</p><p>&#x201c;TOD eighteen-thirty-three.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No sign of struggle, no visible defensive wounds or other injuries. No sign, at a glance, of forced entry. The vic&#x2019;s fully dressed, and there&#x2019;s plenty of easily transported valuables sitting out. It doesn&#x2019;t read sexual assault or burglary. It reads straight murder.&#x201d;</p><p>Peabody lifted her gaze to the message on the wall. &#x201c;Literally reads.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah. Security discs may tell a different tale, but it looks like the vic opened the door&#x2014;someone she knew or thought she knew. Her killer disabled her&#x2014;note to ME to put priority on tox screens, check body for any marks from a stunner or pressure syringe&#x2014;or forced her back here. Places like this have excellent soundproofing, so she could have shouted for help, screamed, and it&#x2019;s not likely anyone heard. Windows are privacy screened.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No sign on her wrists, her ankles that the killer used restraints.&#x201d;</p><p>Eve approached the body now, examined the head, lifted it up, to check the back of the skull. &#x201c;No injuries that indicate blunt force trauma.&#x201d;</p><p>She reached into her own field kit for microgoggles, took a closer look. &#x201c;Abrasion, small contusion. Fell back, hit her head maybe. Disabled, drugged or stunned, either when she opened the door, or if she knew the killer, after he was inside. Back here, carrying her or forcing her. The bedding&#x2019;s not even mussed, the pillows are still stacked up behind her.&#x201d;</p><p>Lifting one of the hands, she examined the fingers, the nails, under the nails. &#x201c;Clean, no trace here, nothing to indicate she got a piece of her killer. You&#x2019;re going to struggle, if you can, when somebody garrotes you, so she couldn&#x2019;t struggle.&#x201d;</p><p>With the microgoggles still in place, Eve leaned over the crystal dish to examine the severed tongue. &#x201c;It looks pretty clean&#x2014;not jagged, not sawed. Probably a thin, sharp blade. Maybe a scalpel. Can&#x2019;t talk trash without your tongue,&#x201d; she said half to herself. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t defend criminals if you can&#x2019;t talk. This was a little something extra, a symbol, a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. token.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;For you.&#x201d;</p><p>Eve studied the message, coated a layer of ice over that sick thought. &#x201c;Like I said, it reads that way. We butted heads over Jess Barrow a couple years back, and just before that when her partner was killed. She was a hard-ass, but she was mostly doing her job. Doing it as she saw it.&#x201d;</p><p>Turning from the body now, Eve walked over into a large and perfectly appointed dressing room. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s got an outfit set out here. Black dress, fancy shoes, underwear, and jewelry to go with it that looks like the real deal. Nothing disturbed. She&#x2019;d gotten out the wardrobe for her dinner meeting.&#x201d;</p><p>She moved from there into an elaborate master bath, all white and silver. More purple flowers&#x2014;must have been a favorite&#x2014;in a square vase of clear glass on the long white counter.</p><p>&#x201c;Towels on a warming rack, a robe on the hook by the shower, a glass of wine and some sort of face gunk set out on the counter.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a mask.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see a mask.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A facial mask,&#x201d; Peabody elaborated, patting her own cheeks. &#x201c;And that&#x2019;s a really high-end brand. Since there&#x2019;s nothing else set out, it looks like maybe she&#x2019;d been about to give herself a facial, have some wine while it set, then take a shower, but she went to answer the door.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, good. She&#x2019;s prepping for the meeting&#x2014;we&#x2019;ll check her home office&#x2014;going to get clean and shiny, but somebody comes to the door.&#x201d;</p><p>Eve walked out as she continued. &#x201c;Nothing disturbed out here. Screen on in the bedroom&#x2014;a little company or entertainment while she gets ready for dinner. She&#x2019;s back there, in the bath or the dressing room when she gets the buzz.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Security on the main door,&#x201d; Peabody pointed out. &#x201c;Buzzed the killer in?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The security feed should tell us. However he got inside the building, she answers the door.&#x201d;</p><p>She imagined it, Bastwick in her swanky at-home wear, going to the door. Look through the security peep first, check the monitor?</p><p>Why have good security if you didn&#x2019;t use it? Used it, Eve concluded, felt no threat. Opened the door.</p><p>&#x201c;He takes her down,&#x201d; she continued. &#x201c;Drags or carries her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Or she took him back?&#x201d; Peabody suggested. &#x201c;A lover maybe?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s got a meeting. She doesn&#x2019;t have time for sex. Not wearing sex clothes, no face enhancements. Could&#x2019;ve forced her back, but it doesn&#x2019;t feel like it. Nothing disturbed. Nothing out of place.&#x201d;</p><p>Eve paused there, went back in, studied Bastwick&#x2019;s feet, still cased in silvery slippers. &#x201c;No scuffs on the heels. She wasn&#x2019;t dragged.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Carried her, then.&#x201d; Peabody, lips pursed in her square face, gauged the distance from living area to bedroom. &#x201c;If he did take her down in here, it&#x2019;s a good distance to cart her. Why?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, why? No overt signs of sexual assault. Maybe he re-dressed her after, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Morris will tell us. Killer gets her onto the bed. No sign she was gagged, but the ME will check that, too. He kills her while she&#x2019;s still out or stunned. Quick, cuts out her tongue to prove a point, writes the message so I&#x2019;ll know what a favor he did for me, then gets out.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s talk to the admin, then review the discs. I want to go over this place before we call in the sweepers.&#x201d;</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>Cecil Haversham looked like his name. Formal with a side of dapper. He wore his hair white, short, and Caesarean, which suited the natty, perfectly trimmed goatee. The center leg pleats on his stone-gray three-piece suit looked sharp enough to draw blood.</p><p>Distress emanated from him in apologetic waves as he sat on a curved-back chair at the side of the lipstick-red dining table with his hands neatly folded.</p><p>Eve nodded to the uniform to dismiss her, then rounded to the head of the table with Peabody taking the chair opposite their witness.</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Haversham, I&#x2019;m Lieutenant Dallas, and this is Detective Peabody. I understand this is a difficult time for you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s very disturbing.&#x201d; His voice carried the faintest whiff of British upper class, though Eve&#x2019;s quick run on him gave his birthplace as Toledo, Ohio.</p><p>&#x201c;How long have you worked for Ms. Bastwick?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nearly two years as her administrative assistant. Prior I served as Mr. Vance Collier&#x2019;s&#x2014;of Swan, Colbreck, Collier and Ives&#x2014;admin.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And how did you come into her employ?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She offered me the position, at a considerable increase in salary and benefits. And I felt moving into criminal law from corporate and tax law would be&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. more stimulating.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As her admin, you&#x2019;d be privy to her case files, her clients, and her social engagements.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, of course. Ms. Bastwick is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. was a very busy woman, professionally and personally. Part of my duties is to arrange her schedule, keep her calendar, make certain her time was well managed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you know of anyone who&#x2019;d wish Ms. Bastwick harm?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As a criminal defense attorney, she made enemies, of course. Prosecuting attorneys, clients who felt she hadn&#x2019;t performed adequately&#x2014;which would be nonsense, of course&#x2014;and those individuals represented by the prosecution. Even some police.&#x201d;</p><p>He gave Eve a steady if slightly distressed look. &#x201c;It would be the nature of her work, you see.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah. Does anyone stand out?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been asking myself that as I sat here, digesting it all. There have been threats, of course. We keep a file, which I&#x2019;d be happy to have copied for you if the firm clears it. But nothing stands out in this way. In this tragic way. Ms. Bastwick always said that if nobody threatened her or called her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. unattractive names, she wasn&#x2019;t doing her job. I must say, Lieutenant, Detective, you must often find yourself in that same position. The work you do creates enemies, particularly, one would think, if you do it well.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t argue there.&#x201d; Eve sat back. &#x201c;Take me through it. When did you become concerned about Ms. Bastwick, and what did you do?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I became concerned, very concerned, this morning. I arrive at the offices at eight-fifteen, routinely. This provides me time to check any messages, the daily schedule, ...</p></p><h2>A Rocket in My Pocket: The Rhymes and Chants of Young Americans (An Owlet Book)</h2><p>"This definitive collection of contemporary folklore includes over 400 verses created by children and passed along for generations.

While some have been much maligned for turning strong career women into weepy marshmallows and spunky teenagers into monosyllabic sulkers, they are hardly just the troublemakers they&#x2019;re made out to be. Hormones are, in fact, absolutely essential. They tell us when we need to eat, sleep, drink, warm up, even when to have sex. They strengthen our bones, alert us to danger, and help keep our bodies and brains vital and fully functional&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s just for beginners. Hormones, in short, are crucial to our very existence. They are the ultimate coordinators, keeping all our bodily parts and functions regulated and directed toward the same purpose&#x2014;whether that purpose is as basic as eating or as complicated as reproduction.<br><br>But powerful as they are, hormones don&#x2019;t act on their own. They are in effect handmaidens of the brain, which is the commander in chief of all body operations. As hormones surge through our bloodstream, they&#x2019;re delivering instructions, generated mainly by our brain, to cells in various sites in our body. (They also deliver information from cells to the brain.) They are the brain&#x2019;s major intercommunication system for transmitting essential information from cells in one part of the body to cells in another. And there are a lot of them flowing through our body at any given time&#x2014;we currently know of more than two hundred hormones, and we are constantly discovering more. Within the last ten years, scientists have discovered at least nineteen hormones that help establish and manage appetite and weight alone. And we&#x2019;ve uncovered a few other surprises that have turned our old concept of hormones upside down and inside out.<br><br><i>NEW FINDINGS</i><br><br>We used to think that hormones were produced only by nine endocrine glands&#x2014;the thyroid, parathyroid, pancreas, adrenals (2), gonads (2: ovaries and testes), pituitary, and pineal&#x2014;and that the hormones these glands produced each had only one function. The ovaries and the testes, for example, were thought to be involved solely in reproduction; the adrenals were meant to regulate stress; the pituitary monitored growth; and so on. But over the last decade, we&#x2019;ve discovered that hormones are not only produced by the endocrine system, but are, in fact, secreted by other parts of our body, as well. Hormones are released by the stomach, skin, bones, white blood cells, even our extra belly fat&#x2014;in fact, almost every part of the body can produce some hormones. That makes for a lot of chemical messages running through our body and a lot of hormonal interaction. Contrary to old-school thinking, no hormone is an entity unto itself. Each one impacts the others, and that mutuality plays a huge role in the way you feel on a day-to-day basis. There are four major hormone groups in terms of function and what they do for you, and even though they cross over into other territories, these categories are their home ground:<br><br><b>Sex hormones</b> (estrogen, testosterone, and progesterone) are the big guns&#x2014;the hugely important hormones produced by your ovaries that we&#x2019;ll be focusing on throughout the book. As a woman, the levels of your sex hormones shift more frequently and more dramatically than most of your other hormones, creating a delicate balancing act with one another and with every other hormone in your body. We&#x2019;ve always known that the sex hormones influence reproductive status and define gender, but we&#x2019;ve only recently discovered that they are much more all-encompassing than had been previously considered. The powerful effects of estrogen on the brain; the rather limited abilities of progesterone in areas other than the uterus; and testosterone&#x2019;s ability to help build muscle, regulate sexuality, and act as a building block of estrogen coalesce to form a fragile relationship that has a tremendous impact on your mental, physical, and emotional well-being. Sex hormones are, in fact, largely responsible for establishing and maintaining a considerable part of adult functioning.<br><br>The <b>metabolic hormones</b> (aka energy hormones): This group, which targets all metabolic processes and monitors and regulates our physiology, includes the thyroid hormones, insulin, growth hormone (GH), and many others. Their job is to regulate how we use our calories&#x2014;the ones from our most recent meal as well as the ones we&#x2019;ve stored as fat. They decide if we need to store our calories, use them to build more tissue, or burn them to keep warm. And they ensure our health and survival by monitoring our need for energy.<br><br><b>Regulatory hormones</b>: These hormones (aldosterone, melatonin, parathyroid hormone, and others) help us maintain body temperature, regulate the amount of urine we produce, adjust to changes in time zones, and monitor the amount of oxygen in our blood. They&#x2019;re the hormones that control how we function in environments ranging from frozen mountain peaks to sweltering deserts. When they&#x2019;re out of balance, they can cause bloating, insomnia, fatigue, sweats, and more.<br><br><b>Stress hormones</b>: which include cortisol, epinephrine, and norephinephrine, among others, are produced mainly in the brain and adrenal glands and serve as our body&#x2019;s alert system. They fire up when something is threatening our health or survival (this includes our need for food and water, temperature stability, and general well-being). When stress hormone levels are briefly elevated, they promote memory formation, motivation, and energy production. When they&#x2019;re chronically elevated, on the other hand&#x2014;a situation that&#x2019;s increasingly common in our fast-paced, multitasking world&#x2014;they can become toxic and adversely affect our emotional state, memory, and even sleep patterns.<br><br><i>HORMONE EQUILIBRIUM</i><br><br>All these hormones operate in your system like a finely balanced mobile. Just as every part of a mobile is interconnected and shifts when one section moves, each of your hormones is interrelated to the others, and a shift in the level of one will invariably affect the level of another, as well as the overall balance of your system. There&#x2019;s a constant breeze moving the mobile pieces, too&#x2014;the environment. (Toxic chemicals in our food, water, and air can disrupt the natural rhythm of our hormones.) When your personal &#x201c;hormonal mobile&#x201d; is well balanced, you feel your best and your health flourishes. When the pieces are tilting too much one way or the other, you get symptoms of hormonal imbalance like sexual dysfunction, mood and sleep disorders, and cognitive problems. And when the mobile is severely askew, serious problems, disorders, and diseases are likely to set in.<br><br><i>THE INTRICATE INTERWEAVING OF HORMONES</i><br><br>The sex hormones are in the center of a woman&#x2019;s hormone mobile because they play the central role in her hormone balance. Aside from their role in reproduction, they provide key functions within each of the other hormone categories. Testosterone, for example, fulfills an energy hormone role by stimulating muscle growth, which helps a woman&#x2019;s body burn more calories. And when estrogen levels are high, they can promote fluid retention, even though fluid balance is technically a regulatory hormone function. It&#x2019;s these kinds of crossovers that make sex hormones so powerful and their balance so vitally important. And because these interhormonal relationships are hugely variable and complex, sex hormone imbalances can manifest as symptoms that may appear to have nothing at all to do with the sex hormones themselves. Estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone play multifaceted roles in mood status (anxiety and depression), temperature changes (hot flashes and night sweats), appetite (cravings), sleep (insomnia), and other regulatory functions.<br><br>A good example of one abnormal hormone level causing an imbalance with others is polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), a common disorder (it affects at least one in ten reproductive-age women) that&#x2019;s usually caused by an abnormally high level of the hormone insulin. Typical symptoms of PCOS are weight gain, acne, excess hair growth, and irregular menstrual cycles. The latest evidence suggests that the high insulin levels actually cause the ovaries to produce excessive testosterone. Once the insulin problem is treated, the other hormonal imbalances often self-correct without additional treatment.<br><br>Another classic example of hormone interdependence is when one hormone prevents the message of another hormone from getting properly delivered to the brain. This block deprives you of a particular hormone and triggers an imbalance. Too much estrone (the &#x201c;bad&#x201d; estrogen), for instance, can block estradiol (the symptom-relieving &#x201c;good&#x201d; estrogen) from entering a cell, effectively producing symptoms of estradiol depletion like hot flashes (more about that on page 223ff.). When hormones multitask successfully, all systems run smoothly. It&#x2019;s only when they fail&#x2014;when your body has exhausted its ability to increase production of a diminished hormone or convert enough of one hormone into another&#x2014;that your brain sends you a warning sign in the form of a symptom. Those &#x201c;whispers&#x201d; are hormonal messages transmitted by the brain to let you know that you&#x2019;ve got a hormonal imbalance&#x2014;and that you should do something about it.<br><br>We actually experience minor brain-hormone alerts on a daily basis. Take perspiration, for example. When it&#x2019;s hot, a reflex initiates perspiration to produce a cooling effect. That in turn results in bodily water loss. Since your health is dependent on maintaining a balance be...</p><h2>Heart Opened Wide: Studies in II Corinthians</h2><p>The ever insightful and thoroughly biblical Dr. Homer Kent Jr. takes on the letter of 2 Corinthians.

The symbol of yin and yang is a circle divided into two halves by an S-shaped line, with one half black and the other half white. </p><p> The circle represents the unity of the universe, consisting of the yin (black) aspects and the yang (white) aspects, inseparable in every manifestation of the whole. Within each half there is a smaller circle of the opposite color, which means that each principle contains the seed of the other. At the culminating moment of deployment and expression, each principle changes into its polar opposite so that the force of eternal equilibrium can do its work. </p><p> <b><i>The Equilibrium of the Universe Depends on Polarity</i></b> </p><p> According to the Tao, the universe is the product of the polarity existing within the primordial unity: rest and motion, contraction and expansion, condensation and scattering, moving backward and moving forward. From the most simple and peculiar manifestations to the most complex and universal ones, every being expresses this original polarity. The interrelationship between yin and yang generates all living things that inhabit the universe. </p><p> The Tao philosophy is based on the search for balance and the integration of opposing energy forces that are complementary to each other. </p><p> <i><b>Yin and Yang</b></i> </p><p> Yin energy represents the feminine: passivity, night, wetness, cold, water, and the moon. The woman, with all her sexual secretions and fluids, constitutes a yin essence that provides the necessary protection that allows the male's semen to become an embryo. </p><p> The woman contains an inexhaustible reserve of yin energy that is activated by sexual arousal. The female orgasm strengthens vital energy, improves health, and prolongs youth. </p><p> Due to the fact that a woman's sexual potential is more energetic and open, almost all texts on this subject place a greater emphasis on educating the man so both lovers can reach an equivalent level of satisfaction. </p><p> Yang energy represents the masculine: activity, day, dryness, sun, and fire. Man's sperm is a precious gift, the source of his physical health and vital energy. This vital energy will diminish unless it is compensated by an equivalent amount of female yin energy, which is why the man must seek to satisfy the woman each time he has sexual contact with her. That way, both will benefit the other during each act of lovemaking: he will strengthen his vital essence, and she will stimulate and intensify her yin essence. </p><p> According to Taoist thinking, the sexual feature of yin is slower excitation, but this also means that a woman is slower to quit at the moment when she needs more sexual stimulation. On the contrary, yang's sexual feature is easy excitability, which allows the man to achieve maximum pleasure instantly. </p><p> The man needs to learn to prolong the sexual act without reaching orgasm so that both energies can merge and fuse. By increasing the time his member remains inside the woman, he will absorb the yin essence that will in turn revitalize him. </p><p> When the man's yang force and the woman's yin force unite, they create life in the universe. </p><p> <b></b></p><b>Infinite Pleasure</b> <p> There are physical and mental exercises that enable a couple having sexual problems to find a balance. These ancient techniques are very effective for people who play routine, stereotyped, or rigid roles in their sexual relations, which may eventually lead to a loss of sexual desire. </p><p> First of all, lovers should work on developing the tenderness of their feelings and express them through caressing each other. Each partner must caress the other in a slow and soft manner, with yin sensitivity. In doing so, not only do the mouth and the fingers take part, but so does the whole body, including those parts that are not usually explored erotically. </p><p> While the partners caress each other, both should focus mentally on the image of a sun embracing the moon with its light beams -- two vital energies becoming integrated. </p><p> The man should excite the woman until they both reach maximum wetness in their erogenous zones. Upon achieving this yin sensation, it is time for the intervention of the yang, with the man's penetration of the woman until the couple achieves maximum pleasure. </p><p> Having completed the sexual act in a state of ecstasy, the couple must wait a few minutes and allow their bodies to relax completely. When they reach this restful state, the lovers should visualize the image of an integrated earth and sky, while holding hands and kissing at the same time. </p><p> If the lovers start caressing each other again, they may get excited anew and perform the sexual act more than twice a day. </p><p> If a couple performs these exercises every day for some time, they will successfully harmonize their yin and yang energies and will experience the highest embodiment of love. </p><p> </p><p> Copyright � 2003 by Mabel Iam</p></p><h2>Yes, I Could Care Less: How to Be a Language Snob Without Being a Jerk</h2><p><p><b><i>Yes, I Could Care Less </i>is a lively and often personal look at one man's continuing journey through the obstacle course that some refer to, far too simply, as "grammar." </b></p><p>These are interesting times for word nerds. We ate, shot and left, bonding over a joke about a panda and some rants about greengrocers who abuse apostrophes. We can go on Facebook and vow to judge people when they use poor grammar. The fiftieth anniversary of the publication of <i>The Elements of Style </i>inspired sentimental reveries. Grammar Girl's tally of Twitter followers is well into six digits.

He is a regular presenter at the annual conferences of the American Copy Editors Society. Walsh is the author of <i>Lapsing Into a Comma</i> and <i>The Elephants of Style.</i>1. <br>&nbsp; <br> <br>Caring, More or Less <br>ARE PEOPLE JUST CARELESS? <br> <i>A turd becomes a fossil.</i> <br>Now, don&#x2019;t get me wrong. <i>Could care less</i> is hardly the most pressing issue in modern English usage, or even my biggest pet peeve. Yes, I <i>could</i> care less, but I could also care <i>more.</i> (I don&#x2019;t like to brag, but I&#x2019;d say my level of caring is precisely where it should be.) Still, the phrase is a handy litmus test: so basic, and yet people get so acidic about it. <br>In this corner are the sticklers, the <i>prescriptivists</i>. We are the copy editors, English teachers, usage mavens, armchair grammarians and others who revel in dos and don&#x2019;ts and in our own opinions, who <i>prescribe</i> usage. If you&#x2019;re a stickler, you deplore the idea of using <i>could care less</i> to mean <i>couldn&#x2019;t care less</i>. What could be more obvious than a preference for saying what you mean over saying the exact opposite? &#x201c;One of the surest ways to show the world that you are a slipshod stylist,&#x201d; writes Charles Harrington Elster in <i>The Accidents of Style</i>, &#x201c;is to write <i>I could care less</i> instead of <i>I couldn&#x2019;t care less.</i>&#x201d; <br>In the other corner are the <i>descriptivists</i> who pooh-pooh our fun. Spoilsports. They emphasize that the language is what its speakers make it, and that speakers handle that responsibility just fine. They see the glass as half full, while we&#x2019;re arguing over whether <i>half full</i> gets a hyphen. They are the linguists and those who have fallen under the linguists&#x2019; spell, the laissez-faire realists who take their pleasure in stepping back, hands off, and <i>describing</i> how language is used. Their only strong opinions are about those who have strong opinions. Jan Freeman, a self-described &#x201c;recovering nitpicker&#x201d; and former language columnist at the <i>Boston Globe</i>, calls the <i>could care less</i> issue &#x201c;one of the great language peeves of our time.&#x201d; Surveying a vast field of sticklers who &#x201c;continue to insist that &#x2018;I could care less&#x2019; really must mean &#x2018;I care to some extent,&#x2019;&#x201d; she retorts: &#x201c;But it doesn&#x2019;t; it never has; it never will.&#x201d; <br> <i>@TheSlot: In spat with partner Vanessa on &#x201c;The Amazing Race,&#x201d; Ralph says, &#x201c;I could care less.&#x201d; She snaps, &#x201c;COULDN&#x2019;T care less!&#x201d;</i> <br>Sifting through the claims and counterclaims about how <i>couldn&#x2019;t care less</i> mutated into its literal opposite and just how wrong or perfectly fine that is, I find it telling just how often people feel the need to explain the literal meanings of the competing versions. <i>Couldn&#x2019;t care less</i> is oblique. It&#x2019;s an intentional double negative, as opposed to the ain&#x2019;t-got-none kind, so processing the meaning requires a couple of seconds&#x2019; thought. (Who has time for <i>that</i>?) Complicating matters further if you&#x2019;re the literal type, the original expression is hyperbolic. Think about it: When someone says &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t care less&#x201d; (or says &#x201c;I could care less&#x201d; and <i>means</i> &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t care less&#x201d;), how often is the subject at hand truly the one thing that person cares least about in the whole wide world? You might say you couldn&#x2019;t care less about the color of the dress that the first lady wore to the State of the Union address, but you&#x2019;d be exaggerating for effect. I could no doubt come up with plenty of things you care even less about&#x2014;maybe the color of the garment worn by a Bulgarian farm wife you&#x2019;ve never heard of before and will never hear of again. Conversely and sort of perversely, saying &#x201c;I could care less&#x201d; would virtually always be literally true, even if it&#x2019;s the opposite of what you meant. <br>A REEL MESS <br> <i>&#x201c;Fasten your seat belts. It&#x2019;s going to be a bumpy ride.&#x201d;</i> <br>What was bumpy in <i>All About Eve </i>was the night, not the ride. <br>Decades of Disparagement <br> <i>Could care less</i> was apparently born in the 1950s. Yes, another baby boomer! Ben Zimmer, the prominent language writer and former dictionary editor, found it in the <i>Washington Post</i> in 1955. &#x201c;Couldn&#x2019;t care less,&#x201d; interestingly, isn&#x2019;t much older&#x2014;Zimmer traces it to 1944. Jan Freeman dug up the earliest known complaint about the variant, a 1960 letter to Ann Landers. Ann sided with the complainer, to the extent that she cared about the issue (yes, she said that extent couldn&#x2019;t have been less). For the next few decades, those who cared enough to write about the dispute agreed with her verdict, if not her lack of ardor. In his <i>Miss Thistlebottom&#x2019;s Hobgoblins</i> (1971), Theodore M. Bernstein of the <i>New York Times</i> bemoaned the &#x201c;senseless abbreviated form&#x201d; but observed that it &#x201c;has not really taken hold.&#x201d; Bernstein opined that people shorten the expression &#x201c;because their hearing is defective or because they are in an inordinate hurry, or merely because they think it cute.&#x201d; <br>Another Timesman, William Safire, was ready to write an obituary for &#x201c;could care less&#x201d; less than a decade later. &#x201c;Happily,&#x201d; he said in an On Language column included in a 1980 anthology, the expression &#x201c;seems to be petering out,&#x201d; having peaked in 1973. He pointed to the <i>Harper Dictionary of Contemporary Usage</i>, which called it &#x201c;an ignorant debasement of the language.&#x201d; (In the same entry, Freeman points out, Isaac Asimov said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know people stupid enough to say this.&#x201d; Ah, those were the days.) Safire concluded: &#x201c;Farewell, &#x2018;could care less&#x2019;! You symbolized the exaltation of slovenliness, the demeaning of meaning, and were used by those who couldn&#x2019;t care less about confusing those who care about the use of words to make sense.&#x201d; The eulogy was premature, and writing in the <i>Times</i> in 1983, Safire observed that &#x201c;the short form is understood and the long form would be regarded as the sort of thing a visiting Martian might say.&#x201d; But he wasn&#x2019;t giving up; in the same column, he spun around to venturing that the phrase would atrophy from disuse. <br>If only. Safire and Bernstein are no longer with us, but <i>could care less</i> lives on, in speech and writing, in sticklers&#x2019; peeves and spoilsports&#x2019; rationalizations. The battle lines are predictable. The not-shy prescriptivist Robert Hartwell Fiske, in his <i>Dictionary of Unendurable English</i>, says, &#x201c;However it is meant, whatever the speaker&#x2019;s intention and inflection, the phrase <i>could care less</i> means just the opposite of the one it is so often misused for.&#x201d; In his <i>Common Errors in English Usage</i>, Paul Brians says, &#x201c;People who misuse this phrase are just being careless.&#x201d; <br>Bryan A. Garner, in his authoritative <i>Garner&#x2019;s Modern American Usage</i>, disapproves of the expression but puts it at Stage 3 on his Language-Change Index, halfway between &#x201c;rejected&#x201d; and &#x201c;fully accepted.&#x201d; That means it&#x2019;s &#x201c;commonplace even among many well-educated people but is still avoided in careful usage.&#x201d; <br>In <i>Word Court</i>, Barbara Wallraff defends the usage as an informal though illogical idiom but says it&#x2019;s &#x201c;not considered appropriate for formal speech or writing.&#x201d; <br> <i>Webster&#x2019;s New World Guide to Current American Usage</i> summarizes the history and concludes that &#x201c;the efforts of conservative English-speakers are not likely to be successful, for <i>could care less</i> seems too well established to be dislodged now.&#x201d; <br> <i>@TheSlot: Care for some whip cream on your Belgium waffle? And how about some more ice tea?</i> <br>On the let-it-be side of the spectrum, Jan Freeman has plenty of company. John E. McIntyre of the <i>Baltimore Sun</i>, like Freeman a self-styled reformed stickler, says that <i>could care less</i> is an idiom and that idioms are inherently illogical. &#x201c;You may not care for <i>could care less</i>, but I could care less about your objections,&#x201d; he writes on his blog. &#x201c;And frankly, apart from the tiny company of peevers, no one else gives a tinker&#x2019;s damn either.&#x201d; Freeman, writing in the <i>Boston Globe</i>, elaborates on the idiom notion: &#x201c;So let&#x2019;s stash the phrase in the &#x2018;idioms&#x2019; bin, along with &#x2018;head over heels&#x2019; and &#x2018;have your cake and eat it too,&#x2019; and forget about it. Truly, there is nothing more to say.&#x201d; <br>A DICTIONARY DISSENT <br> <i>Accouterments, accoutrements</i> <br>Maybe I&#x2019;m just a pretentious person who hangs out with other pretentious people, but I&#x2019;ve never heard someone say &#x201c;a cooter mint&#x201d;&#x2014;it&#x2019;s always the French pronunciation, and I think the word should get the French spelling. The <i>Merriam-Webster</i> and <i>American Heritage</i> dictionaries agree, leaving <i>Webster&#x2019;s New World</i>&#x2014;which is the basis for most U.S. newspapers&#x2019; style decisions&#x2014;as the outlier. <br>Meanwhile, I&#x2019;ll be calling an envelope an <i>EN-velope</i> and calling a niche a <i>nitch</i> and calling the <i>AHN-velope</i> and <i>neeche</i> people pretentious, so maybe consistency isn&#x2019;t my forte. (That&#x2019;s <i>fort</i>, not <i>for-TAY</i>.) <br>The Logic of Sarcasm <br>I&#x2019;m not so sure there&#x2019;s nothing more to say, and not only because I promised the publisher 60,000 to 70,000 words here. I used to think <i>have your cake and eat it too</i> was nonsensically redundant, until I realized that the <i>have</i> means &#x201c;possess,&#x201d; not &#x201c;eat.&#x201d; Other sticklers point out that <i>eat your cake and have it too</i> would be more logical. That might be a good edit, if we were allowed to edit old sayings, but I see no illogic in the standard word order. <i>Head over heels</i> is illogical, but it&#x2019;s truly an idiom, in the sense that a logical version does not exist. When you open the catalogue to shop for an expression, <i>heels over head</i> is not there. It may have once been extant, but now it&#x2019;s extinct. The logical <i>I couldn&#x2019;t care less</i>, on the other hand, is <i>right there in front of you</i>. It&#x2019;s readily available. Not only that: Unlike some sticklerisms, it costs no more than the illogical alternative. When we insufferable pedants choose <i>careering down the street</i> rather than <i>careening down the street</i>, or <i>stamping ground</i> over <i>stomping ground</i>, or even <i>running the gantlet</i> rather than <i>running the gauntlet</i>, we pay a price. Our words might be received with raised eyebrows or blank stares or &#x201c;What are you talking about?&#x201d; or even &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not the right word!&#x201d; The variants are well on their way to eclipsing the originals. But <i>couldn&#x2019;t care less</i> is alive and well. It&#x2019;s an unremarkable expression. There&#x2019;s an expression for such expressions, and that expression is &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the expression.&#x201d; Does a failed attempt to reach for another expression even count as an idiom? <br>Some defenders of <i>could care less</i> bravely venture out of the immunity-from-making-sense zone and argue that the expression is sarcastic, or at least ironic. McIntyre covers both bases, observing in another post that &#x201c;when I ask if anyone has ever taken &#x2018;I could care less&#x2019; in any sense other than the ironic, no volunteer has stepped forward.&#x201d; In the traditional sarcasm model, I suppose, one would be sneering &#x201c;I could care less&#x201d; with the same tone used for &#x201c;I just <i>love</i> looking at pictures from your vacation in Gary, Indiana.&#x201d; Or&#x2014;different tone, same result&#x2014;the expression is shorthand, a clipped way of saying &#x201c;I <i>could</i> care less, but I don&#x2019;t.&#x201d; A modern variant offers myriad choices for the colorfully profane: &#x201c;I could <i>give</i> a [bleep].&#x201d; (Imagine Rhett Butler&#x2019;s line updated to &#x201c;My dear, I could <i>give</i> a damn.&#x201d;) <br> <i>@TheSlot: &#x201c;There are those who disagree with me. Such people are best ignored, if not shunned by polite society.&#x201d; #firstdraft #workinprogress</i> <br>These observers, in many cases, see the sarcasm as obvious. In his book <i>The Language Instinct</i>, psychologist Steven Pinker chastises people like me who fail to hear this in the spoken form, who have a &#x201c;tin ear for prosody (stress and intonation) and an obliviousness to the principles of discourse and rhetoric.&#x201d; Contending that the stress in <i>I could care less</i> is on the <i>care</i>, whereas in the original expression it&#x2019;s on the <i>couldn&#x2019;t</i>, he cites this as an illustration that the newer version &#x201c;is not illogical, it&#x2019;s <i>sarcastic</i>.&#x201d; He continues: &#x201c;The point of sarcasm is that by making an assertion that is manifestly false or accompanied by ostentatiously mannered intonation, one deliberately implies its opposite. A good paraphrase is, &#x2018;Oh yeah, as if there was something in the world that I care less about.&#x2019;&#x201d; (He further attributes the &#x201c;could care less&#x201d; usage to &#x201c;today&#x2019;s youth&#x201d; and &#x201c;teenagers,&#x201d; which strikes me as even stranger than the sarcasm assertion. Plenty of my usage peeves are generational, but this isn&#x2019;t one of them.) <br>Michael Quinion, on his World Wide Words site, endorses the Pinker theory and says, &#x201c;The intent is obviously sarcastic&#x2014;the speaker is really saying, &#x201c;As if there was something in the world that I care less about.&#x2019;&#x201d; He goes on to speculate: &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a close link between the stress pattern of <i>I could care less</i> and the kind that appears in certain sarcastic or self-deprecatory phrases that are associated with the Yiddish heritage and (especially) New York Jewish speech. Perhaps the best known is <i>I should be so lucky!</i>, in which the real sense is often &#x2018;I have no hope of being so lucky,&#x2019; a closely similar stress pattern with the same sarcastic inversion of meaning.&#x201d; <br>To me, the intonation is flat, not sarcastic&#x2014;and, though my Yiddish is pretty rusty, most certainly not Jackie Mason-sarcastic. Garner writes: &#x201c;Although some apologists argue that <i>could care less</i> is meant to be sarcastic and not to be taken literally, a more plausible explanation is that the <i>-n&#x2019;t</i> of <i>couldn&#x2019;t</i> has been garbled in sloppy speech and sloppy writing.&#x201d; ( <i>Apologists. Sloppy speech and sloppy writing.</i> I like Garner.) He quotes a linguist named Atcheson L. Hench, who wrote in 1973: &#x201c;A listener has not heard the whole phrase; he has heard a slurred form. <i>Couldn&#x2019;t care</i> has two dental stops practically together, <i>dnt</i>. This is heard only as <i>d</i> and slurring results. The outcome is <i>I c&#x2019;d care less</i>.&#x201d; <br>On Language Log, Mark Liberman vigorously defends <i>could care less</i> as &#x201c;a well-accepted colloquial expression in contemporary American English&#x201d; but also disputes the sarcasm idea. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a <i>reeaallly</i> great hypothesis&#x2014;I just <i>looovvve</i> it,&#x201d; Liberman says of Pinker&#x2019;s passage. (No, he doesn&#x2019;t. I made that last quote up.) Liberman does, however, sort of imply that Pinker has a tin ear for prosody (stress and intonation). He questions (a) whether Pinker is accurately capturing the way people say those phrases and (b) whether, even if he&#x2019;s right about the way people talk, sarcasm can necessarily be inferred from it. I&#x2019;m not a linguist&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t have access to Mark Liberman&#x2019;s fancy voice-o-meters or even, presumably, his ear for prosody (stress and intonation)&#x2014;but that&#x2019;s in line with what I&#x2019;ve felt since I first heard the same argument. I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ve ever heard &#x201c;I could care less&#x201d; said with a sarcastic tone. And besides, can you be sarcastic on behalf of a third party? I&#x2019;ve certainly never heard &#x201c; <i>He</i> could care less&#x201d; or &#x201c; <i>She</i> could care less&#x201d; or &#x201c; <i>They</i> could care less&#x201d; said with a sarcastic tone. And it&#x2019;s not easy to write with sarcastic stress and intonation, at least not without italics or capital letters or boldface. Liberman also dismisses the notion that the usage is a youth phenomenon. (Hey, we&#x2019;re getting along pretty well for two people who disagree about the main point here.) <br> <i>@TheSlot: Walsh&#x2019;s Law: Whichever horn of a usage dilemma you grab, your editor or your slot or the person proofing the page will choose the other one.</i> <br>Liberman&#x2019;s analysis of what is happening, given that sarcasm <i>isn&#x2019;t</i> happening, is fascinating and complicated, full of cool new terms ( <i>negation by association, the minimal object, negative polarity item, the contractual associate of the negation</i>). It&#x2019;s all rather inside-baseball, but I&#x2019;m sort of the linguistics ...</p><h2>Thomas the Tank Engine the Railway Series (Classic Thomas the Tank Engine)</h2><p>Thomas the Tank Engine and his friends remain as popular as ever, loved by millions all over the world. Now rediscover the classic stories about the world&#39;s best-loved tank engine with these stunning new hardback editions of the original &#39;Railway Series&#39;. In Thomas the Tank Engine, Thomas runs up and down the track, but all he really wants is a branch line of his own...Thomas the Tank Engine has been delighting generations of children for over 70 years. It all began as a story made up by the Reverand W. Awdry to entertain his son when he had measles. Now millions of people across the world have grown up with the tales of Sodor Island, enchanted by the adventures of Thomas and his friends, Percy, Gordon, and Toby, and all the other engines that work on the Fat Controller&#39;s railway. Have you collected all the adventures in the Railway Series? Thomas the Tank Engine; Troublesome Engines; James the Red Engine; Tank Engine Thomas Again; and, The Three Railway Engines. Also look out for the Railway Series Boxed Set.</p><p>In this first book in The Railway Series, we meet Thomas for the first time. Once he proves himself to be a Really Useful Engine, he is given a Branch Line all to himself.Reverend Wilbert Awdry was born in Hampshire in 1911. He grew up close to the railway and was convinced that the steam engines all had different personalities. He used to imagine conversations between them. Later when he was grown up and his son Christopher became ill with measles, Wilbert invented the Thomas stories to entertain him. Christopher kept asking for more stories and Wilbert began writing them. The first of the railway series was published in 1945. Awdry wrote 26 Railway books in total before Christopher took over the series.</p><h2>Just Show Up: And Other Enduring Values from Baseball&#39;s Iron Man</h2><p><p><strong>New York Times Bestseller. </strong></p><p><strong>Iron Man Cal Ripken Jr.&#x2014;the 19-time All-Star, World-Series winning legend, American League MVP, and record holder who played 2,632 consecutive games&#x2014;outlines eight rules for the game of baseball and life, drawn from the lessons he has learned on and off the field.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Cal Ripken Jr. is a baseball legend.

For twenty-one seasons, Ripken took the field day in and day out, through cold, heat, rain, and sometimes snow, playing in more than 3,000 games for the Baltimore Orioles. In 1983, the revered shortstop helped lead his team to victory in the World Series. On September 6, 1995, Ripken did the seemingly impossible, he surpassed Lou Gehrig's unbreakable fifty-six-year-old Iron Man record, setting a new mark of 2,131 consecutive games&#x2014;then played another 501 consecutive games. Throughout his career, Ripken was admired for his consistency, hard work, and loyalty. There were successes and failures, but above all was an old-fashioned sense of doing what's right, every single day. </p><p></p><p>Since retiring in 2001, Ripken has enjoyed a successful career as a baseball analyst, entrepreneur, and author. Now, in&nbsp;<em>Just Show Up</em>, he reflects on his life and career to offer lessons for the next generation and those to come. Ripken speaks eloquently about the timeless values he has lived by: Life is a streak,play the long game; Success and money are not the same; Play fair,win fair. And he shares stories of his legendary father, Baltimore Oriole coach and manager Cal Ripken Sr., what it took to keep the streak alive, and what it meant to bring the World Series to Baltimore.</p><p></p><p>Cal Ripken's message is simple yet poignant; wisdom essential to anyone trying to forge a successful life in times that are often chaotic.

Liang</h2><p>Gordon Muir began his martial arts studies at the age of twelve, followed by years of serious study of a wide variety of disciplines including judo, kyokushinkai, karate, kempo, several kung fu styles, and kickboxing. Eventually he discovered the internal martial arts, which led to t&#x2019;ai chi and Master T. T. Liang, renowned teacher of Yang style. The culmination of the author&#x2019;s longtime study of this style is this enlightening look at the Yang style of t&#x2019;ai chi. Focusing on the revered traditional form rather than the more recently created short form, the book describes in depth the type of movement t&#x2019;ai chi strives for that distinguishes it from other martial arts. Clear and concise instructions help students understand how to move in order to create internal strength. Numerous photographs and detailed descriptions showcase and simplify the movements, which include the traditional Yang stances, hand and arm positions, and moving and powering. Written in a simple, engaging style, the book is designed to help new students get started in this rewarding tradition and more advanced practitioners deepen their knowledge of it.</p><p>Gordon Muir studied intensively with Master Liang for seven years and for another seven with students of Master Liang and with his own students. Currently a disciple of Master Chen Zhonghua, he lives in Victoria, British Columbia.&#x201c;As a young man Gordon Muir was a hard stylist who studied the soft styles first from books, and then went to extraordinary lengths to track down a great Taiji master. May his example inspire other external artists to pursue the internal arts. Gordon's book is a great place to start; his down-to-earth practical approach makes clear the more esoteric rewards of Taiji that come only through sincere, diligent practice.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Brian Preston, author of <i>Me, Chi, and Bruce Lee: Adventures in Martial Arts</i></p><h2>Rosary of Liberation</h2><p>A catholic prayer book that includes miraculous testimonials that strengthens the person faith.</p><p>This is a catholic prayer book.

The little blue church of <i>Coming Through the Blizzard</i> is based on a church in a neighborhood where she used to live.Kindergarten-Grade 2-On Christmas Eve, as snow blankets his community, a minister waits and wonders who will make it to the evening service. The lyrical text describes the arrivals: "The starling came/on snowy wings across a starless sky./The starling came,/frosty and fuddled,/to huddle on a cushion in candle glow,/beneath a branch of the shining tree./The starling came." The bird is followed by the custodian, Tom Cat, a small boy in his mother's arms, a field mouse, the organist, a moth, and the soloist. The small blue church begins to fill up; however, it is not until the last guest, a stranger, arrives that Christmas comes. The colored-pencil illustrations highlighted in gouache supply warmth to the narrative and the brightness of the last spread brings a glow to the story.

Ursula Mahlendorf, born to a middle-class family in 1929, at the start of the Great Depression, was the daughter of a man who was a member of the SS at the time of his early death in 1935. For a long while during her childhood she was a true believer in Nazism&#x2014;and a leader in the Hitler Youth herself. </p><p>This is her vivid and unflinchingly honest account of her indoctrination into Nazism and of her gradual awakening to all the damage that Nazism had done to her country. It reveals why Nazism initially appealed to people from her station in life and how Nazi ideology was inculcated into young people. The book recounts the increasing hardships of life under Nazism as the war progressed and the chaos and turmoil that followed Germany&#x2019;s defeat.</p><p>In the first part of this absorbing narrative, we see the young Ursula as she becomes an enthusiastic member of the Hitler Youth and then goes on to a Nazi teacher-training school at fifteen. In the second part, which traces her growing disillusionment with and anger at the Nazi leadership, we follow her story as she flees from the Russian army&#x2019;s advance in the spring of 1945, works for a time in a hospital caring for the wounded, returns to Silesia when it is under Polish administration, and finally is evacuated to the West, where she begins a new life and pursues her dream of becoming a teacher.</p><p>In a moving Epilogue, Mahlendorf discloses how she learned to accept and cope emotionally with the shame that haunted her from her childhood allegiance to Nazism and the self-doubts it generated.</p></p><p><p>Ursula Mahlendorf earned her PhD in German Literature from Brown University in 1958 and spent the rest of her professional life teaching in the German Department and Women&#x2019;s Studies Program at the University of California, Santa Barbara.</p>&#x201c;<i>The Shame of Survival </i>is a compelling memoir of a girl&#x2019;s experiences growing up in Nazi Germany that analyzes the lifelong implications of Nazi indoctrination on a sensitive, thoughtful young woman. It shows how a reluctant, shy, frightened, and na�ve BDM member becomes swept up in Nazi ideology and documents the lifelong psychic ramifications of living with that legacy: feelings of guilt and shame, a need to work through these experiences and to take responsibility for and mourn the past. Focusing on both class and gender, Mahlendorf&#x2019;s memoir offers a unique and valuable perspective on a growing body of emergent belated narratives on Nazi Germany by German �migr� academics.&#x201d;<p></p><p>&#x2014;Anna Kuhn, University of California, Davis<br><br>&#x201c;Ursula Mahlendorf&#x2019;s <i>The Shame of Survival</i> is a beautifully written autobiographical account of a former BDM (League of German Girls) leader who was a loyal supporter of the Nazi regime until its demise, when she suffered a major crisis in her entire belief system. Such eloquent, thoughtful accounts of a German <i>girl&#x2019;s </i>experience during World War II have been rare, and Mahlendorf&#x2019;s incisive gender analysis provides a firsthand look at how women and girls were cynically co-opted by the Nazis. Mahlendorf contextualizes her experiences within the larger frame of German military aggression and the Holocaust, focusing not only on the brutal consequences of unquestioningly following the Nazis, but also on how her traumatic postwar expulsion from the East caused her to reevaluate everything she had been taught during the Third Reich.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Erin McGlothlin, Washington University in St. Louis<br><br>&#x201c;As a young teen, she was a bystander; if she had been old enough, would she have been a perpetrator? It is that dual perspective that gives this memoir its power: the immediacy of her memoirs; the shame, remorse, and uncertainty of remembering. . . . The personal experience is haunting about then and now: how you can develop a shell of toughness and numbness and not know what is happening at Bergen-Belsen, only fifty miles away from where you live.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Hazel Rochman, <i>Booklist</i><br><br>&#x201c;This is a brave, honest account of a young girl&#x2019;s experience in Nazi Germany, and especially of how women and girls were exploited.

"His right hand engulfed mine in a leathery grip and I held onto it for longer than might have been called for," says detective Cecil Younger of a meeting with an ancient bearer of secrets about old and new murders. "It wasn't until after my grip tightened on his that I felt the quaver of his body his left hand betrayed. I saw in his blue eyes the distant haze of ice, the toehold of confusion and uncertainty. William Flynn was a very old man in a durable body. His soul was a weary traveler. Looking at him I began to feel uncomfortable, as if I were walking over a canyon on a narrow railroad bridge hearing a train whistle far down the line."

I complained to my roommate, Amy. I had decided to go on the retreat to get away from the stress in my life, and was ecstatic when I discovered that Amy and my boyfriend, Mike, were also going. My excitement turned to dismay when I discovered that the girl who was constantly trying to break up my relationship was also going on the retreat. "Just look at her! We haven't even left yet and she's already all over him! Maybe this retreat wasn't such a good idea after all," I whined. </p> <p>Amy and I watched as Mike untangled himself from the girl and headed our way. "It's a test, Mol," Amy began. "It's a test from God. Are you up to it?" </p> <p>"Hope so," I replied, as we piled into the car. </p> <p>Once we arrived at the lodge, our team leaders did some icebreakers to help us get to know each other. The first icebreaker paired two people together. Guess who got paired together? Mike and the girl. I glared as she snuggled up to Mike and asked him to tell her about himself. I looked over at Amy, who was looking at me and mouthing the words, "Test from God." </p> <p>It was time for a break, so I headed to the bathroom. I heard someone come in, then a voice said, "Well she's his girlfriend, but don't worry, because by the end of the retreat . . ." I stepped out of the stall, and the girl stopped speaking. Giving her a fierce glare, I stormed out of the restroom in search of Amy. When I told her what had happened, she replied just as she had earlier, "It's a test, Mol. What kind of person are you going to be?" </p> <p>I didn't get the chance to respond because we were being corralled into small groups for discussion. Sure enough, when I arrived at the place where my group was to meet, she was the first person I saw. I could not believe my luck. I kept trying to think of what horrible thing I had done to make God punish me like this. Mike and I were finally together after a year and a half of struggling over whether or not to take our very close friendship to the next level. I didn't want to go through all of that again. I decided that later that night I would talk to him about the girl. He wasn't showing any interest in her, but the fact that she was wherever he was grew increasingly frustrating. </p> <p>My thoughts were interrupted because small group discussion began. The topic was faith and spirituality, and everyone was sharing a little about his or her faith. When it was her turn, I listened to her talk about how she had lost members of her family this year and was very frustrated with God. "I don't really have any spirituality," she said, while staring at the floor.</p> <p> During reflection time, her comment about not really having any spirituality was all I could think about. <i>Did she really mean that</i>? I watched her sitting quietly across the room, and knew she needed someone to talk to. Thoughts of "What Would Jesus Do?" wandered through my mind. Even though I had some extremely hostile feelings toward this girl, I knew someone needed to reach out to her. I took a scrap of notebook paper and scribbled the following note: "I'm glad you're here this weekend! If you need someone to talk to, I'm willing to listen. Have a good weekend! God bless, Molly." </p> <p>The next morning at breakfast the girl approached me. It wasn't until she got close that I realized she had tears in her eyes. "Thank you so much for your note," she told me. "You are the sweetest person!" She threw her arms around me and sobbed. I hugged her back for a very long time. When I looked up, Amy was smiling at me from across the room. </p> <p>That night, Mike and I went for a walk to talk about the situation. I explained to him what she said in the small group, and told him about the note I had written to her. I wanted to be able to help this girl, but I didn't know if I could do it. I didn't even know if she wanted help. After a while, we stopped and silently watched delicate snowflakes cover the ground in the season's first snow. </p> <p>Mike made me feel better. "First of all, realize that nothing she can do will ever pull us apart. We've been through too much to let that happen," he said. "And as for helping her, you can do it, Molly. You can do it if you try. Just give it a chance. Sometimes you just have to let go and let God take care of it."</p> <p> I went to bed thinking about those words and woke up with a different attitude. From then on, Tracy and I became closer. We shared our heartbreaks and our happiness, and learned a lot about each other. At times, she reminded me a little bit of myself. As we prepared to leave the retreat, everyone was trying to get the chance to say one last goodbye to the people they had shared so much with. When she and I found each other, we burst into tears and embraced. We stood there hugging each other as the group began to say the "Our Father." When they got to the part where it says, "Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us," I realized I had figured out what it was all about. </p> <p>Amy had been right. The retreat was a test from God. Before the retreat, I had been trying to deal with so many things�my mother had been seriously ill for months, I had two thesis papers due within the next two weeks, and I had gotten so run down from trying to deal with it all that I had very little self-esteem left. I felt like I was at the end of my rope. During that "Our Father," I realized that God had given me an opportunity to show to myself what kind of person I was. I realized what it meant to be a child of God. Suddenly, all of the things I was so worried about before the retreat didn't seem so important anymore. I didn't have to do it all alone.

It represents both life and death, appearing at weddings and funerals. In their pure white form, lilies are a symbol of innocence, chastity, and purity of heart, but in contrast, the highly fragrant and intensely colored orange lilies symbolize passion. In <i>Lily</i>, Marcia Reiss explores these paradoxes, tracing the flower&#x2019;s cultural significance in art, literature, religion, and popular entertainment throughout history.&nbsp;Reiss journeys from the tomb carvings of ancient Egypt to the paintings of Claude Monet, Georgia O&#x2019;Keeffe, and Salvador Dal�, exploring the lily as a subject of fascination and obsession. Unearthing many absorbing facts and fables about the blossom, she examines its use in cuisine and reveals them to have&nbsp;been a source of food and medicine in China for centuries. While Reiss focuses her attention on true lilies and the ornamental hybrids breeders have derived from them, she also provides extensive information about a wide variety of popular lilies, including daylilies, lilies of the valley, water lilies, and calla lilies. Filled with striking illustrations of these gorgeous plants, <i>Lily</i> is a book for gardeners and lily admirers alike.</p><p><b>Marcia Reiss</b> is the author of many books focusing on New York history and architecture and has worked for New York City government, nonprofits, universities, and newspapers.

We live in an era when our children&#x2019;s life spans may be shorter than those of their parents&#x2019;, an era when cancer is the foremost cause of death of children under fifteen, an era when diabetes and obesity are rampant&#x2014;three times the rate of a generation ago. It will take us all to reverse these stats.</p><p>And it will take healthy, unprocessed food.</p><p>Food literacy must be one of our most important goals in overcoming our country&#x2019;s food and health crises. But where do we start? It begins by finding our kitchens again; and not only finding them but also sharing them with our families&#x2014;and most especially our kids! Schools can be part of the solution, but parents also have a major role to play.</p><p>Enter <i>The 52 New Foods Challenge</i> by Jennifer Tyler Lee.</p><p>In this book, and the Crunch a Color game that complements it, we meet a mom, advocate, and inspiration who helps families move from bland to bountiful plates&#x2014;from the freezer section to the farmers&#x2019; market. Through an ingenious and simple game, <i>The 52 New Foods Challenge</i> inspires kids, their parents, friends, and families to get into the kitchen to cook, taste, and eat healthy, unprocessed foods&#x2014;together.</p><p>I believe that the 52 New Foods Challenge is a positive journey that every family can embark on. With it we can truly change not only our children&#x2019;s relationship with food but also our own. This book may actually help families save the health of our children, our nation, and perhaps our planet as well!</p><p>&#x2014;Chef Ann Cooper</p><p></p><p></p><p><i>The 52 New Foods Challenge</i> is about more than the foods&#x2014;it&#x2019;s about the journey the foods take you on. Along the way, you will experience failures and frustrations, successes and celebrations. In the end, though, you will transform the way your family eats because of the experience you have together.</p><p>Maybe your kids refuse to eat their vegetables and you&#x2019;re at your breaking point. Or you feel like you&#x2019;ve done everything right, preparing wholesome meals from the start, and all of a sudden your kids no longer eat the healthy foods they once did. You may have a family that eats healthy most of the time, but you&#x2019;re looking for ways to break your recipe rut and try something new. Regardless of the reason, the solution lies in taking the journey together.</p><p>I started the 52 New Foods Challenge to get my kids past pasta and peas and to encourage them to be more willing to try new foods. What I discovered was that the journey wasn&#x2019;t about getting my kids to change. It was about creating a change in me. The 52 New Foods Challenge transformed me, which in turn transformed our family dinners.</p><p>The key to making a change at your family table lies in learning to see things in a new light&#x2014;to change your perspective. That&#x2019;s hard. This book will help you get there. Peppered throughout this book, I have included stories from my family&#x2019;s adventure&#x2014;what worked and what didn&#x2019;t&#x2014;and practical tips to help you achieve your goal. My hope is that my story will inspire your story. Meet your family where they are, and move forward from there. Everyone will start at a different place, and everyone can make lasting changes. This is your family&#x2019;s adventure, and like any good recipe, the secret is to make it your own.</p><p>&#x2014;Jennifer</p><p></p><p></p><p>Introduction</p><p>In every job that must be done <br>There is an element of fun <br>You find the fun, and snap! <br>The job&#x2019;s a game.</p><p>&#x2014;MARY POPPINS</p><p>Where We Began</p><p>When my daughter, Catherine, was two, she ate everything. A happy little sprout, she would bounce around the table snatching and sampling healthy bits of food until her big, round belly was satisfied. I was a beaming mom. To be sure, she had her go-to favorites like &#x201c;habas&#x201d; (otherwise known as strawberries) and &#x201c;mum mums&#x201d; (her code for mushrooms), but for the most part she had a pretty broad palate and was willing to try new foods without much fuss. Naively, I thought I had avoided picky-eater syndrome and the terrible dinner struggles that plagued most of my friends at the time.</p><p>But as we inched toward kindergarten, my proud-parent glow faded as my daughter&#x2019;s interest in a colorful plate waned. How could it be that yesterday she loved broccoli and today she ran from it as if it were a dragon with fangs? Instead of a colorful rainbow of healthy, wholesome foods, her plate looked more like a tired ski run at the end of a long winter season&#x2014;whitish brown with a few trampled sprigs of green peeking out here and there, longing for a taste of spring sunshine. Even worse, my diet seemed to be trailing downhill along with hers. &#x201c;Why bother to cook it if she&#x2019;s not going to eat it?&#x201d; I reasoned, as my healthy diet was reduced to pasta and peas. Dinner was dreary.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t give her an option!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Picky eaters are made, not born!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;One family, one meal.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If she doesn&#x2019;t eat what you serve, she&#x2019;ll be hungry and eat at the next meal.&#x201d;</p><p>This was the advice I got from trusted doctors and family friends, but I was completely unwilling to swallow it. Forcing my kids to eat went against every single motherly instinct in my body. To me, it felt like a military deployment: Make a plan, send out your best troops, and stick to your guns with an unrelenting will to wear the enemy down. I didn&#x2019;t want mealtime to become a battleground in my family.</p><p>I tried to understand why Catherine was becoming pickier, but her fickleness made no sense to me. &#x201c;What child doesn&#x2019;t like bananas?&#x201d; I would ask rhetorically. I was immensely frustrated. All of that frustration spilled over onto the dinner table, and though I&#x2019;d vowed not to let it happen, mealtime became an experience that we all wanted to avoid. I bargained and bribed. I begged and badgered. At my lowest point, I heard myself screaming, &#x201c;Why won&#x2019;t you eat your vegetables?&#x201d; What I hadn&#x2019;t realized was that I was asking the wrong question.</p><p>I needed to be asking myself, &#x201c;Why <i>will</i> my kids eat their vegetables?&#x201d; It&#x2019;s a subtle difference, but that change invited a playful challenge to be taken on together as opposed to setting up a challenge against me.</p><p>I was desperate for a solution and equally determined not to give up. I wanted the dinner table to be a place where we gathered for wholesome food, good fun, and treasured time together. I knew there was a better way, I just didn&#x2019;t know how to get there&#x2014;yet.</p><p>A surprise moment during a typical Monday morning routine gave me the inspiration. My husband, Anthony, was getting the kids washed, brushed, dressed, and ready for school. On the days when I was in charge of getting everyone out the door, there was usually rushing and barking involved (and I&#x2019;m not talking about our family dog). But Anthony has a magical way of making just about anything fun. That morning, after they worked on a Lego project in the living room, he started to get the kids ready for school. &#x201c;Race ya!&#x201d; he yelled as he charged up the stairs to brush his teeth. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see if we can beat our record getting to school this morning!&#x201d; he challenged. Giggling and skipping, my kids happily got themselves organized and were out the door, backpacks and lunches in tow, without any screaming or cajoling required. I watched the whole thing unfold as if I were watching a movie&#x2014;with awe and disbelief. As the car door slammed and they cruised down the street, an idea popped into my head: &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t I make healthy eating a game?&#x201d;</p><p>Making It a Game</p><p>That night, I made up a dinner game based on earning points by eating different colors. The premise was simple&#x2014;more colorful vegetables and fruits meant a healthier meal. The more challenging the food, the more points you could earn: 5 for apples, 10 for broccoli, and 15 for kale. Bonus points for trying a new food.</p><p>Kale becomes cool when it&#x2019;s worth 15 points, and the race for bonus points suddenly had my kids begging for new foods to try. Beans, broccoli, and even Brussels sprouts started showing up regularly at our family dinners. Not every food was met with a joyously warm welcome, but we were heading down the right path. With care and time, our simple mealtime game grew organically around our family table, rooting its way into the fabric of our meals, until counting colors became second nature. When a nutritionist I met with said, &#x201c;This is exactly how we teach about nutrition, but it&#x2019;s way more fun!&#x201d; I realized that I might be onto something.</p><p>My kids embraced the idea and helped me to create Crunch a Color, an award-winning healthy-eating game that is now sold nationwide. Suddenly, my in-box was filled with messages from parents around the country sharing stories about how this simple game was changing the way their kids looked at vegetables&#x2014;as a fun challenge rather than a forced mandate. Making healthy eating a game not only worked at our table, it was also working at tables across the country.</p><p>52 New Foods</p><p>In my family, Crunch a Color was the start of our new, healthier relationship with food. It got us out of an intractable place. It made food fun and reduced stress at our family table. More important, making healthy eating a game opened the door to even bigger changes for our family, the kind that would establish a lifetime of healthy eating habits&#x2014;for all of us.</p><p>My kids were now counting their colors without much prompting from me. They knew what a balanced plate looked like. Their favorite part of the game was to earn a card that would double all of their points by trying something new. That simple challenge helped pique a willingness to try new foods. So at the beginning of the new year, we decided to take on a family challenge: 52 weeks, 52 new foods.</p><p>I knew that for any change to stick, it had to be simple. Saying that we were going to &#x201c;eat healthy&#x201d; was too broad (and overwhelming). On the other hand, saying we were going to try one new food each week, and cook it together as a family, felt tangible. I knew what that meant, and so did my kids. It also felt like something I could handle&#x2014;once a week was doable, but anything more felt like way too much for our busy lives. I certainly couldn&#x2019;t commit to cooking at home every night of the week, or going cold turkey on things like canned soups and packaged granola bars, but making a commitment to cook together with my kids once a week felt manageable. We all agreed that this was something fun for us to do as a family. Taking on this challenge together was another essential ingredient to success&#x2014;that way everyone was working toward the same goal.</p><p>Each week, we would head to the farmers&#x2019; market or local grocery store, and my kids would choose a new, healthy food to try. Like players in a scavenger hunt, my new-food adventurers would race from stall to stall, scouting out our new food of the week. Sometimes it was a vegetable that we had yet to try together, like artichoke or zucchini. Other times it was a seasonal favorite that we decided to try in a new way, like cherries or plums. This simple activity kept us focused on local, seasonal produce (and away from anything that arrived in a box, bag, or can). Then together, we would cook. &#x201c;Easy enough for a five-year-old to make!&#x201d; was our mantra. Cooking together as a family, we learned to make easy, healthy recipes that we could all enjoy. We chronicled the entire journey, keeping track of favorite ingredients, quick tips, and easy recipes, making it simple to stay on track. Unusual new foods like Romanesco and quinoa joined us for dinner, along with familiar favorites prepared in new ways. But the change to healthier eating wasn&#x2019;t because I was dictating the menu with a tiger mom&#x2019;s iron fist. Our 52 New Foods Challenge worked because it was easy and fun for the whole family&#x2014;it engaged all of us.</p><p>At the time I thought this challenge would simply be a way to get my kids to try a few new foods&#x2014;to add variety to our table beyond broccoli, beans, and blueberries. What I discovered was that the 52 New Foods Challenge was the catalyst for much deeper and longer-lasting changes in the way that we were eating&#x2014;not just for my kids but for our whole family. The 52 New Foods Challenge laid the foundation for a lifetime of positive and healthy eating habits centered on whole, nutritious foods. It brought us together to cook and enjoy healthy food as a family.</p><p>Small steps. Big changes.</p><p>If I had tried to make all of the changes in this book in one fell swoop, I would have failed. My kids would have thrown up their arms in protest and outright refused to make the changes we needed to make. I can hear it now: &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like brown rice!&#x201d; or &#x201c;Those vegetables taste too bitter!&#x201d; or the crowning glory of all comments, &#x201c;Ew! What&#x2019;s that green stuff?&#x201d; What&#x2019;s more, I never would have been able to <i>sustain</i> the changes&#x2014;in the way that I shopped, or cooked, or engaged my kids in the whole process. It&#x2019;s the same reason why most diet plans fail&#x2014;they are impossible to maintain for most people because they don&#x2019;t effect a true change in your lifestyle. The best way to make healthy changes is with small, simple steps taken consistently each week.</p><p>The bad news: There isn&#x2019;t a quick fix. Your kids won&#x2019;t go from eating pizza and chicken nuggets to pesto and quinoa in a month, or even three months.</p><p>The good news: This plan will work because it changes your family&#x2019;s behavior the slow and sustainable way. The 52 New Foods Challenge helps you make a change at the core of how your family approaches food. You will establish a lifetime of healthy habits by learning to explore and enjoy healthy foods together as a family. And establishing healthy habits at an early age has a dramatic, positive impact on the health of your child throughout his or her life. As noted by Dr. Walter Willett, the head of nutrition at Harvard University&#x2019;s School of Public Health, &#x201c;This has a direct effect because we have seen diets of children being related to risks of cancer and other conditions later in life.&#x201d;</p><p>And it takes only an hour each week, so that even the busiest of parents can help their families make positive changes that will stick.</p><p>It was the small steps we took together each week that resulted in a change that could really take hold in our family. It allowed healthy habits to sink in and take root. It took time for me to learn how to cook <i>with</i> my kids (not <i>for</i> my kids), and for my kids to learn how to cook! Allowing time to explore new foods gave us the opportunity to try lots of different recipes, to experiment with different textures and tastes, and to uncover each person&#x2019;s preferences as opposed to forcing a &#x201c;one size fits all&#x201d; approach to food. Just like eating our colors, these healthy habits became second nature because we stuck with them for the long haul. It was the culmination of a series of small steps that resulted in the big, lasting change for our family.</p><p>The 52 New Foods Challenge inspired everyone in our family to try something new each week, it encouraged us to start a garden, it brought us together to cook and enjoy healthy food as a family, and it connected us with fellow food lovers in our community. We learned about where our food comes from, the people who work tirelessly to grow it, and how the food choices we make impact our bodies, our neighborhood, and the...</p></p><h2>Valhalla</h2><p>1st edition Little, Brown hardcover 1980 good ex library book vg dw complete solid clean In stock shipped from our UK warehouse</p><p></p><h2>Los Paisanos</h2><p><p>Little has been written about the colonists sent by Spanish authorities to settle the northern frontier of New Spain, to stake Spain&#x2019;s claim and serve as a buffer against encroaching French explorers.

He could remember the night before up to a certain point and then things went blank. He had come awake with a sore neck and a throbbing headache sitting at his desk in the pressroom and had no idea how he had ended up there. His hand lifted to massage his brow and tipped his hat from his head. When he stooped to pick it up off the floor, he nearly blacked out. The hat kept moving away from his groping hand. He sat back in his chair, hatless, and closed his eyes. Someone entered."The top of the morning to you, Tetzel."There was no need to open his eyes to know that it was Tuttle. He heard the little lawyer collapse in a chair whose squeak went through Tetzel's nervous system like a laser."Stop rocking, damn it.""You're not feeling well.""Could you whisper?""You should have left when I did, Tetzel."The reporter opened one eye, the one nearer to Tuttle. "Were you there?""Everyone was there.""When did you leave?""Just after my curfew."Tetzel considered asking Tuttle where "there" was, or had been, but he was at enough of a disadvantage already. "I feel awful.""Better come across the street."For a remedial drink? Minutes before, Tetzel would have found the suggestion emetic. Now it seemed only sensible. "Hand me my hat."Tuttle swept it up and stood. He put the hat on Tetzel's head and helped him rise. He guided the reporter down the hall to the elevator, steered him inside, and pressed a button. Tetzel felt that he was leaving his stomach on the floor they had left. His body broke out in a cold sweat. Vague memories of sobriety teased his mind. Once he had been a clearheaded reporter, a model for youngsters, a legend because of the novel he was allegedly writing. They arrived safely on the ground floor; the doors slid open, and Tetzel hung back. Before him, in the lobby of the courthouse, were busy men and women, hurrying this way and that. Tetzel was sure that each and every one of them could give a clear account of the way he had spent the previous night. Tuttle urged him forth, and they crossed the black and white marble squares to the revolving doors. They actually entered together, a tight fit, but Tetzel wondered if he would have dared the door on his own.Outside was more normalcy, sunlight, traffic, horns, the usually inaudible roar of the city. Tuttle wisely took his charge to the corner, and they crossed with the light. Ahead lay the friendly confines of the Jury Room.Once inside, Tuttle's grip on his arm loosened and Tetzel moved like a zombie toward a far booth, as far from sunlight as any in the room. At the bar, Tuttle ordered a Coke for himself and a Bloody Mary for Tetzel. The bartender was watching Tetzel. The reporter looked as if he were one of the Flying Wallendas negotiating a ropehigh above a circus audience. His arms were extended for better balance."He going to be sick?""He is sick.""Put him in the men's room.""Now, now, Portia, that's no way to treat a steady customer.""He isn't steady.""He will be."Tuttle swept up the drinks, called, "Tetzel's tab," over his shoulder, and walked carefully to the booth. He put Tetzel's drink before him and slid into the seat across from him. The reporter was contemplating the Bloody Mary."Tell me about last night.""What's to tell?""You don't remember," Tetzel said accusingly. He lowered his lips to the plastic straw and his cheeks hollowed. He inhaled half the drink before sitting back. A moment passed. Color came back to Tetzel's face. Another moment and he sighed. "I needed that."Tuttle advised against a repetition of the remedy. With his synapses responding, Tetzel was inclined to dispute the point. Tuttle opened the newspaper he had taken from the bar, turning the pages with an indifference that annoyed Tetzel."Good Lord," Tuttle cried."What?" Tetzel asked, trying to signal Portia."They plan to tear down St. Hilary's."STAINED GLASS. Copyright � 2009 by Ralph McInerny. All rights reserved. Printed in the United States of America.

Never before had America's native music been treated so meticulously, objectively, and comprehensively. The appearance of two later volumes, <i>The Encyclopedia of Jazz in the Sixties</i> and <i>The Encyclopedia of Jazz in the Seventies</i> (with Ira Gitler) only confirmed the initial enthusiasm and the judgement that here were basic books for any music library.This marks the first paperback publication of this book, soon to be followed by paperback editions of the other two volumes. With more than 2,000 biographies and 200 photos, it spans the history of jazz from its origins to 1959. But more than a biographical dictionary, the book also features essays on the jazz tradition, its major players and composers, the relationship between jazz and classical music (written by Gunther Schuller), a social history of jazz in America, the jazzman as critic, and a grammar of jazz language that can serve as an ideal introduction for young listeners. In addition, Leonard Feather provides a chronology, list of international critic polls, musicians birthdays and birthplaces, a bibliography, and a discography of recommended recordings. For anyone seriously--or even casually--interested in the development of jazz and blues, this classic reference work can guide you unerringly through the many dimensions of the music's wonderful history.</p><p><b>Leonard Feather</b> is one of the handful of indispensable jazz critics. His many books include <i>From Satchmo to Miles, Inside Jazz, Laughter from the Hip</i> (with Jack Tracy), all published by Da Capo Press/Perseus Book Group, and the <i>Pleasures of Jazz,</i> along with other works. Composer, pianist, record producer, critic, he remains a vital presence on the jazz scene.</p><h2>Eileen George&#39;s Conversations In Heaven II</h2><p>&#34; Eileen is described keenly in the introduction to the book as &#34;a laywoman, wife and mother of eight, one especially devoted to her state of life, a woman devoted to prayer who generously accepts repeated trials and sufferings to obtain the grace and conversion and holiness for all and especially priests. &#34; That, also , is how I know Eileen. It certainly is not how Eileen things of herself! Conversations in Heaven records dialogues between Eileen, Jesus and the Father as they took place in 1982. Eileen is Eileen in these conversations. It is a book of revelational prophecy, seek in to bring people into a more intimate union with God.

He reads with a Canadian accent. The brief story is broken up frequently by the Canadian Brass performing excerpts of Christmas music; the arrangements are often interesting but not necessarily kid-friendly or upbeat, especially the discordant and decidedly minor "What Child Is This?". When the story's ending--bitter, sad, regretful, resigned--is followed by "O, Christmas Tree," it seems ironically cruel. Unfortunately, this program is misconceived for adults and children alike.

As a result of these acclamations, this book is considered one of the greatest novels written on the Civil War.</p><p>This novel reveals more about the Battle of Gettysburg than any piece of learned nonfiction on the same subject. Michael Shaara&#39;s account of the three most important days of the Civil War features deft characterizations of all of the main actors, including Lee, Longstreet, Pickett, Buford, and Hancock. The most inspiring figure in the book, however, is Col. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, whose 20th Maine regiment of volunteers held the Union&#39;s left flank on the second day of the battle. This unit&#39;s bravery at Little Round Top helped turned the tide of the war against the rebels. There are also plenty of maps, which convey a complete sense of what happened July 1-3, 1863. Reading about the past is rarely so much fun as on these pages.It's hard to limit myself when talking about this book because it is simply one of the best books I've ever read. But it wasn't until the second reading that I appreciated this. I read it in college, among the million other books an English major must read, and I liked it. Then, when we published Gods and Generals, I figured I'd read Killer Angels again, just to refresh my memory. And it was if I'd never read it before. Names and places that had simply been history before now took on new meaning and importance. It gave me a whole new understanding of the Civil War and the why's of it all.

The author is obviously a big fan of Ronstadt's, and his biography intersperses the facts of her life with effusive praise of her musical accomplishments. Bego takes us from Ronstadt's childhood in Tucson, Ariz., where she first became "mesmerized by music," through the mid-1960s in Los Angeles as the lead singer for the Stone Poneys, her superstar period as "the most successful female singer of the 1970s," and her forays into opera, jazz and mariachi music during the last decade. Along the way, we learn, rather sketchily, about Ronstadt's affairs with singer J. D. Souther, actor Albert Brooks, former California governor Jerry Brown and filmmaker George Lucas, among others. Bego relies on past interviews from a multitude of magazines and newspapers, and although he has done a capable job of pasting together quotes from various sources to create a coherent chronology, rarely does he attempt to probe beneath the surface of Ronstadt's California cool. Photos not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.A thorough look at the public and private life of one of pop music's most creative and diverse talents, this offering is sure to be of interest to Ronstadt's many fans and to students of pop culture. While offering nothing of great revelation regarding Ronstadt's personal or professional life, Bego does fill a void by bringing together numerous secondary sources of information on the artist. Furthermore, he surveys and updates Ronstadt's fast-moving career accomplishments as a folk/country/rock/pop vocalist, opera diva, producer, and stage actress. In a sometimes plodding but usually engaging style, the author provides the first fresh look at this multi-talented performer in ten years.

They lurk nearby when he takes the trash out in the evening, on the other side of the curtain when he's taking a shower, and all over his room at night. (Thank goodness they're afraid of ladders and he sleeps on the top bunk.) When he sees a sign for karate classes, he decides it's time to learn some fancy moves and overcome his fears. Though the story is hardly groundbreaking, it is an accurate and humorous reflection of childhood concerns. Mayer's trademark cartoon style is well suited to the bevy of silly and scary monsters that skulk around corners and cower in terror before a child gains confidence and takes charge.<i>&#x2013;Kathleen Kelly MacMillan, Maryland School for the Deaf, Columbia</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

While not traveling the world in search of adventure, Steve Irwin, along with his wife Terri, runs one of the largest private zoos in Queensland, Australia. Steve met Terri when she made an unplanned stop at Steve's parents' Reptile and Fauna Park, and the two were married in June 1992. <b>The Crocodile Hunter</b> is their first book. <br>Terri Irwin has had a lifelong love affair with animals. As a child in Eugene, Oregon, she helped her parents rescue injured animals, and then later helped to start a rehabilitation facility called Cougar Country in her native state, while also working as a veterinary techician. Terri works alongside Steve as director of Australia Zoo, conducting wildlife education programs throughout Australia, and raises their daughter, Bindi.While many U.S. readers will be familiar with Australian Steve Irwin's good-mate/wild-man persona from his smash hit cable show Crocodile Hunter, they may be surprised by the passion and thought with which Steve and his wife, Terri, undertake wildlife conservation work. Neither will fans be bored: this entertaining, exciting autobiography/adventure tale/environmental tract is packed, as advertised, with incredible feats. Steve is son to the man "recognized as the greatest herpetologist in Australia and revered throughout the world as a legend for catching highly venomous snakes" bare-handed. The first section recounts Steve's childhood with his conservation-minded father and mother ("She was the Mother Teresa of wildlife rehabilitation"), who built the Queensland Reptile and Fauna Park, soon enlarged and renamed the Australian Zoo, one of the best zoological facilities in the world. As the park expanded, Steve learned to leap from boats onto the backs of crocodiles of all sizes, capturing them for relocation. The second section is told by Terri, an impressive Oregonian nature lover who was running a wildlife rehabilitation facility when she met Steve on a trip to Australia. While Steve punctuates his writing with phrases like "Holy snappin' duck poo!" Terri offers a calmer perspective on their commitment to wildlife conservation. The final section discusses the Irwins' current efforts at the Australian Zoo: "Our passion for wildlife is our elixir of life and we'll die defending animals that others deem dangerous and threatening." What could have been an easy rip-off of a popular show is a fun, educational read for adults and children alike. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Rich Sex�: The Sexual Dynamics of Money</h2><p>Diamonds are not a girl's best friend-Ginie is!Learn what Rich Men confided in Private Consultationswith Ginie-their secrets about sex and love:How money influences their sex livesThe 6 Rich Sex� Styles of SeductionHow a combination of sex &amp; moneyinfluences their choicesof women for relationshipsIt is surprising-and not what you think!Ginie's Registered TrademarkRICH SEX� "The Sexual Dynamics of Money?"tells you:What makes Rich Men tick in the bedroom-and in love, marriage, mistresses,living together, engagements, and more!Education is the key-Don't you deserve a richer sex life?</p><p>Dubbed THE MARRY RICH CONSULTANT by the Media, GINIE SAYLES spent 20 years as a Consultant to Celebrities and the Rich on business and personal relationships.

"Black Jack" Pershing (1860&#x2013;1948), who is most famous for leading the American Expeditionary Forces in World War I. The only soldier besides George Washington to be promoted to the highest rank in the U.S. Army (General of the Armies), Pershing was a mentor to the generation of generals who led America's forces during the Second World War.<br><br>Though Pershing published a two-volume memoir, <i>My Experiences in the World War</i>, and has been the subject of numerous biographies, few know that he spent many years drafting a memoir of his experiences prior to the First World War. In <i>My Life Before the World War, 1860&#x2013;1917</i>, John T. Greenwood rescues this vital resource from obscurity, making Pershing's valuable insights into key events in history widely available for the first time.<br><br>Pershing performed frontier duty against the Apaches and Sioux from 1886&#x2013;1891, fought in Cuba in 1898, served three tours of duty in the Philippines, and was an observer with the Japanese Army in 1905 during the Russo-Japanese War. He also commanded the Mexican Punitive Expedition to capture Pancho Villa in 1916&#x2013;1917. <i>My Life Before the World War</i> provides a rich personal account of events, people, and places as told by an observer at the center of the action.

Coffman, author of The War to End All Wars: The American Military Experience in World War I</i></p><p>"It would be difficult to overestimate the impact that Pershing had on American military history.

His memoirs deserve to be read and appreciated, but they require the carefully crafted context that Greenwood has provided."&#x2015;<i>On Point</i></p><p>"So many who achieve great things become fixed in stone as monuments. <i>My Life before the War</i> is a reminder that John J.

What does goodness mean? What is the role of government? Where does duty end and morality begin? And most often: What does it mean to be human?<br>The Last Conversation is a poignant exploration of the inner world of Gene Roddenberry as he faced the end of his life. Insisting that no one could really know him or the sources of his creation without becoming part of his private world, he invited Yvonne Fern to live with him and his wife, Majel Barrett. "I want you to write me," he said, and later told her she had. The Last Conversation, however, is more than a portrait of a single life - it is an intellectual embrace. Well-matched in the velocity of their imagination and the depth of their understanding, Gene and Yvonne shared a journey into the meaning and worth of human existence.<br>As Gene receded from life, Yvonne's increasingly solitary task was to convey the richness, the insight, the radiance they saw in each other and in humanity. This beautiful book, written as a philosophical dialogue, is a last confessional call upon centuries of earlier attempts to codify our understanding of human experience and what lies beyond.<br>Throughout their intense dialogue, Gene never once spoke of the future in the future tense. It was never "the future will be," but always "the future is." Echoing this immediately, the book is written in the timeless present, allowing each of us to take part in The Last Conversation.<br>As we read and reread this stunning work, we are moved a little closer to the luminous future that Gene Roddenberry knew was already within us.</p><p>The creator and driving force behind both the original <i>Star Trek</i>� and <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i>�, Gene Roddenberry created a mythology for the twentieth century. One of the most enduring cultural phenomenons of our time, <i>Star Trek</i> was from the beginning a forum where its creator, its writers and its viewers could explore the fundamental questions of life: What does goodness mean? Where does duty end and morality begin? And most often: What does it mean to be human? <p> In the last months of his life, Roddenberry offered to share his views on life with Yvonne Fern. The result is a probing dialogue that serves as a portrait of both the man and his ideas. Roddenberry's creation opened a window into the human condition and has stirred the dreams of an entire generation. Now, reading this final message, we are moved a little closer to the luminous future that <i>Star Trek</i> showed was already within us.</p>It is Roddenberry's time in the book world, as witnessed by Gene Roddenberry by Joel Engel (Nonfiction Forecasts, Mar. 21) and Star Trek Creator by David Alexander (Nonfiction Forecasts, May 16)--and now this volume, which is the most reverential. The tone is set by the book's inclusion in a new UC series, Portraits of American Genius. Fern, an ex-nun and a Trekkie, lived with Roddenberry and his wife during the last year of his life (1990-91) and views him as a visionary. Their discussions dealt with questions like "What is life," "What is the role of faith in human existence?" and other staples of pop metaphysics, plus a bit about Roddenberry's psychology. The book will appeal primarily to the most devoted Trekkies, who will not be daunted by such terms as "mind-meld," "Borgs," "IDIC" and "pon farr." $30,000 ad / promo; author tour. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Making Pictures: Three for a Dime</h2><p>In the 1930s the Massengill family of rural Arkansas built three portable photography studios on old truck frames, attached each to the back of any car that would run, and started a mobile photo booth business that would last for a decade. Without formal training they invented ways to mimic the popular photo booth and brought their business to the dirt roads and open fields. <i>Making Pictures</i>, featuring Massengill family prints and photo albums collected by the artist Maxine Payne, illuminates a Depression-era South previously unseen by the public. Unlike the hardscrabble lives captured by WPA photographers, the Massengill photographs often show folks working to look their best. Hand-painted backdrops, colorized prints and the occasional prop add a playful edge to these scenes. Not unlike photographs by Vivian Maier or Mike Disfarmer, the Massengill photographs invite us to reconsider a time and place from a new perspective.</p><p>The history of these photos is more than enough to get your attention, but the images and the book itself are valuable additions to an increasingly crowded field.--Pat Padua &#34;Spectrum Culture &#34;</p><h2>Knight on the Texas Plains (Texas Heroes, 1)</h2><p><p>"Linda Broday's heroes step right out of her books and into your heart." &#x2015;<strong>JODI THOMAS</strong>, <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author</p><p><strong>He'll do whatever it takes<br> To keep them safe</strong></p><p>Duel McClain has lost everything he's ever loved: his wife, his son, his sense of self.

Now, under the glare of the close-ranked floodlights along the Outer Drive, she saw the black lake reach a fist in past the wintry void, where summer knew a strip of sunwhite beach. Above the ice-draped slats of snowfence the fist shook spume at city and civilization, then crashed down, dissolving itself in an open-handed splash that washed across six of the eight lanes of forty- mile-per-hour traffic. The traffic wavered, minimally slowing, some of it skidding perilously in the freezing wet. If things kept on this way, the police were going to have to close the Drive.<br>Twenty or thirty yards inland, on pavement separated from the Drive and the reaching waves by a wide divider strip of frozen parkland, Kate's Lancia purred sedately south. Most of her attention was concentrated upon the task of reading addresses from the endless row of tall apartment building fronting on Drive and park and lake. The particular numbers she had been looking for now suddenly appeared, elegantly backlighted against a towering granite wall. She slowed and turned. The righthand curve of driveway went down to a basement garage, but she stayed with the left branch, rolled past two parked Cadillacs and a Porsche, and pulled up under the building's entrance canopy.<br>Despite the heatlamps fighting down against the wind and cold, the uniformed doorman wore earmuffs above the collar of his winter jacket. His eyeglasses were so thick as to resemble frosted protective goggles of some sort. Taller than he, Kate swept in through the door that he held open for her, meanwhile pulling back the hood of her warm blue jacket from natural blond curls.<br>"I'd like to see Craig Walworth. Tell him Kate Southerland is here," she told the man when he had followed her into the lobby. A few moments later, after the intercom had brought down Craig's acceptance of her visit, she was alone in a small elevator.<br>If Joe were with her now, he'd be worrying about what the doorman was going to do with the car--or about something else, about anything, maybe just about dropping in on a party unannounced. But then if Joe were with her tonight, she wouldn't be coming here at all. Which, of course, was really the whole point. She hadn't made any commitment to Joe--not yet. If and when she did, things, would be different.<br>And how they would.<br>Maybe the real point was the fact that she felt compelled to make the point. If she was so certain of her present freedom, why was she here trying to prove something to herself? She could have gone Christmas shopping instead. And she probably should have. For one thing she still faced the problem of a gift for Joe, who was certain to spend too much of his money buying one for her...<br>The elevator, having gone as high as it could go, eased almost imperceptibly to a stop and let Kate out into a small marble lobby from which two massive doors of handcarved black wood, one at each end, led to two apartments. A small decorative table, ivory-colored to contrast with the doors, stood in the middle of the lobby facing the two elevators. On the wall just above the table there hung a picture, or perhaps it was a mirror, of which only an edge of antique gilt frame was visible. Someone had draped an old, worn-looking raincoat over it, perhaps thinking that the loser of the garment would be sure to see it there if he came back. He'd need something warmer than that if he came back tonight.<br>The right hand door stood slightly ajar, and through this opening came sounds of subdued partying: music, an alto laugh, a glassy clink, and voices murmuring. Kate pushed the thick door fully open and slowly walked on in. She stood in a brick-floored vestibule, from which two interior hallways led off at right angles to each other. A third wall was taken up by a great guest closet, open now to show a modest miscellany of coasts and scarves, some fallen from their hangers. It didn't seem that any very large party was going on.<br>"Hi" The greeting was conspiratorially low. Simultaneously a black-haired, black-bearded head bobbed into Kate's view from two rooms down the hallway to her right. Craig Walworth was three or four years older than her twenty. No more than an inch taller, but so wide across the chest that he looked larger than he was. Often, as now, his shirt was worn halfway open down the front to display some hair and muscle; and he tended to have his large hands planted on his hips--one of them was there now, the other holding a drink --so that standing near him put you at some risk from jutting elbows. "Glad you could make it, Kate. I was starting to think you were really out of circulation." The drink he had been holding somehow already stashed away, he took her jacket as she slipped it off, and with a toss consigned it to the closet's minor chaos.<br>"You put out a standing invitation for Friday nights, Craig. I'm just taking you at your word."<br>"I'm just delighted that you are, Sweetie. Our little group here will never be the same--thank God." Craig's voice was still low, uncharacteristically near the whispering level, and now he glanced about, a man checking to see if he might be overheard. "Now listen, Doll, there's a little house rule I've got to mention before you join the group."<br>"Rules? That's not quite what I would have expected at your parties."<br>"Well, you see, it's not your basic expectable kind of rule." As they talked, he had started her moving down the hall toward the still rather muffled sounds of partying, with an arm round her waist that she somehow minded more than the expected cheek-kiss following. "The thing is, everyone--expect me, of course--takes a new name for the evening, and pretends to be someone other than they are. You should be...how do you like Sabrina? Sabrina Something and I'll; say that you're an old friend of mine from Canada. How's that?"<br>"Well, I did think of becoming Sabrina once, believe it or not. When I was about thirteen years old."<br>They had now come to a room where four or five people were gathered, all standing, as if none of them had been here very long. Kate so rarely remembered names the first time round that sometimes she was tempted to give up trying; and since these were supposedly all aliases anyway, she made no effort to retain anything from the round of introductions.<br>Beside Kate stood a tall girl wearing an odd shawl who wanted to find out how much Kate knew about Tarot cards. When she heard the answer was nothing at all, she wanted to explain them at great length. Kate tried for a little while to make sense of it, and then, as the group shifted, took the first opportunity to move away. She was offered a drink, declined then thought that the next time she would accept. In the background she could hear a heavy door, probably the front door of the apartment, being firmly closed. Craig had excused himself, and was somewhere around a corner, talking on the phone.<br>"Try a joint?" This from a stocky young man with thick glasses who had not been in the group the first time round--no doubt there might be other people she had not met, in other rooms; it must be a huge apartment. The man making the offer got too close, and stared at Kate intensely. Being given a man's full attention is a thrilling experience for a woman--well, sometimes. Hadn't she seen him somewhere else recently? But she had no intention of asking that aloud.<br>Kate puffed twice and put the thing down. As expected, she felt nothing from it just at first. The first few times that she had tried, in school, nothing at all had happened to her. The few times after that had always resulted in a pleasant high, with slow onset and letdown. She wouldn't be surprised if it was nothing at all again tonight; quite likely she was just too keyed up, too nervous, though why she should be...<br>"...play games in a little while, you know, identities and such." Craig was back at her side, finishing a statement whose beginning Kate had somehow missed. "And someone else is coming, Sabrina, someone I want you to meet. I've mentioned you to him, and he's very interested."<br>Oh? My Canadian background?"<br>Craig's eyes were sparkling with some inner amusement under their dark brows. But now his attention was forced away by someone else, a blondish boy with a loud mouth, who had some interminable anecdote to tell him, as one insider to another. Craig responded with off-hand but deliberate insults, which the loud one laughed at foolishly.<br>Kate almost tripped over the tall girl, then sat down beside her on the thick, burgundy-colored carpet. "What sort of games is he talking about?" Kate asked. The girl said something Kate couldn't catch. Very loud music was starting in the next room. The Pointer Sisters?<br>Upon the wall that Kate was facing there hung an Escher print, the circle of lizards crawling up out of the flat surface of the drawing-within-the-drawing, crawling up and around an improvised ramp of books and geometric solids, to ease themselves at last down into the flat again, where in three shades of gray their bodies formed a tessellated pattern. Kate willed for a moment to lose herself in the intricacies of the plan, but her mind was too restless.<br>She looked around abruptly, with the feeling that someone, on one she knew, had just called her real name: a loud, rude calling in a strange man's voice. But no one else seemed to have noticed it at all. And the voice seemed to have come, now that she thought about it, directly into her mind, not through her ears. Dear Kate, she warned herself, neither you Sabrina had better smoke any more tonight.<br>Restlessness pulled her to her feet. A bar-on-a- cart offered bottles and glasses and ice. Shouldn't mix with the other stuff, but just a taste was not going to do her any harm. In her hand a glass half-filled with white wine she wandered, mocking a slinky tall-model walk, up to a window of very solid, unopenable glass that looked out far above the endless chains of headlights and taillights of the drive. Beyond the few additional streetlamps that were scattered through the park, the lake stretched out to the edge of everything, a vast black invisibility like death.<br>One of the nameless boys she had just met came to the window too, ice cubes tinkling in his glass like Christmas music. God the shopping she had yet to do. What was she here for, anyway? Trying to prove a point to Joe, who didn't know where she was, and who, when she told him, would fail to get the--<br>Her name again, but still unspoken.<br>Looking down a vista of the apartment's archways, Kate saw a huge, dark-haired man standing gazing toward her. An early Orson Welles, but harder-faced, in a brown coat made of those rich fake-furs, like her own blue. Or maybe in his case the fur was real. He was standing there as if he had just arrived, though if her sense of the place was right, he was nowhere near the front entrance.<br>With a vague feeling that it was important, necessary for her to do so, Kate turned from the window and walked toward the newcomer. No one else seemed to be paying either of them the least attention. The Pointer Sisters grew louder still, then faded abruptly as a door somewhere behind Kate was closed. She was alone with the huge man in the hallway--no, not quite alone From the corner of her eye Kate saw Craig walk out of another doorway to her left. Craig fell into step beside her as she walked the last few strides toward the big man who stood waiting.<br>They stopped. Craig put his hands on his hips, then at once let them slide off to hang fidgeting at his sides. "Enoch Winter," he said, almost whispering again, "this is Kathryn Southerland."<br>The huge man said something (what?) to her in and offhand sort of greeting, and she replied. He was really massive, and Kate was reminded of when she had met an All-American defensive end: perfect proportions, but blown up larger than real life seemed to have the right to be.<br>Enoch Winter's dark hair was slightly curly, and worn shorter than that of most young men. There were only the beginnings of lines in his face. Still, at second glance Kate would not have called him young if she had had to set down a description. His eyes were gray-blue, his broad, pale cheeks a little blue with what would be heavy stubble in a few hours if he let it grow. He was smiling confidently at Kate, and all but ignoring Craig. He spoke to her again; once more she somehow could not grasp what he had said.<br>There was a brief distraction as the short young man with thick eyeglasses appeared from somewhere to stand at Kate's right, looking on in silence. The four of them in the hallway were closed off now by doors on every side. Beyond the closed doors, the sounds of the party went on.<br>Enoch Winter spoke, and Kate stared at him, straining to understand. His voice was loud enough. And she had thought the pot would not take hold of her tonight. She shouldn't even have tasted the wine.<br>He chuckled, perhaps at something he had just said himself. He didn't seem to notice that she could not comprehend what he was saying. Or else he did not care. With a faint inward start Kate realized that Craig and Thick-glasses were no longer at her sides. They had gone away somewhere, leaving her standing in the shut-off hall with Enoch Winter, who talked and talked, to her alone. She must not ever let her attention waver form him for a moment, must not...<br>His whitish hand, raised, was so big that the great dark stone that rode one finger in a silver ring seemed not only modest but scarcely adequate. Just past his waving hand Kate's eye caught sight of a phone on a hall table, and it came to her with desperate force that there was something she must do at once.<br>"Excuse me a moment," she broke in clearly. "I've got to call home right away."<br>"...hafta do that for?" His accent was midwestern, vaguely rural. All of a sudden he wasn't happy any more.<br>"I have to. That's all." Walking to the phone was the most utterly wearying thing that Kate had ever done. She managed to do it, though.<br>"...careful whatcha say. All right." Enoch's voice had regained some of its good humor, and now good-humoredly he fell silent.<br>Kate punched at buttons. She could hear the phone at home start ringing, and then a familiar voice.<br>"Hello, Gran. I just wanted to tell you..."<br>What could she say? What was she able to say? "I didn't do any shopping after all. So I couldn't get those things you wanted."<br>"Well, goodness, dear. Don't worry about it. You sound upset, are you all right?"<br>"Fine."<br>"Well, I expect I'll be going out myself tomorrow, I can do my own shopping. Where are you?"<br>A leaden pause, in which Kate could feel her own mind groping. Crawling. Trying to get free, but leashed. "Downtown," she got out last. It was almost the truth, the closest thing to truth that she could manage.<br>"Take care now, Kate, they say the roads are very nasty."<br>As she cradled the phone Enoch started talking to her again. In this case it really was flattering to have such concentrated attention form a man, attention of a kind she could not get often enough form Joe.<br>Somehow or other they now were standing by the guest closet and Enoch was watching while she put on her b...</p><h2>Lockdown: Escape from Furnace 1</h2><p><p>Furnace Penitentiary: the world's most secure prison for young offenders, buried a mile beneath the earth's surface.

Born in 1979 in Norwich, England, he always wanted to be a writer. After experimenting in the service and retail trades for a few years, Smith decided to go to University. He studied English and American Literature at the University of East Anglia, and it was here that he first explored his love of publishing. Along with poet Luke Wright, he founded Egg Box Publishing, a groundbreaking magazine and press that promotes talented new authors. He also started writing literally hundreds of articles, short stories and books ranging from <i>Scooby Doo</i> comic strips to world atlases, <i>Midsomer Murders</i> to <i>X-Files</i>. The research for these projects led to countless book ideas germinating in his head. His first book, <i>The Inventors</i>, written with his nine-year-old brother Jamie, was published in the U.K. in 2007. He lives in England.</p>NO WAY OUT <p>If I stopped running I was dead.</p><p>My lungs were on fire, my heart pumping acid, every muscle in my body threatening to cramp. I couldn&#x2019;t even see where I was going anymore, my vision fading as my body prepared to give in. If the siren hadn&#x2019;t been hammering at my eardrums, then I&#x2019;d have been able to hear my breaths, ragged and desperate, unable to pull in enough air to keep me going.</p><p>Just one more flight of stairs, one more and I might make it.</p><p>I forced myself to run faster, the metal staircase rattling</p><p>beneath my clumsy steps. Everywhere around me other kids were panicking, all bolting the same way, to safety. I didn&#x2019;t look back to see what was behind us. I didn&#x2019;t need to. I could picture it in my head, its demonic muzzle, silver eyes, and those teeth&#x2014;like razor wire.</p><p>Someone grabbed my arm, pulling me back. I lost my balance, spilling over the railing. For a second the yard appeared five stories beneath me and I almost let myself go. Better this way than to be devoured, right? Then the beast shrieked through its wet throat and I started running again before I even knew I was doing it. I heard the rattle of the cell doors, knew they were closing. If I was caught out here, then I was history. I leaped up the last few steps, hurtling down the narrow landing. The inmates jeered from their cells, shouting for me to die. They stuck out their arms and legs to trip me, and it almost worked. I staggered, lurched forward, falling.</p><p>Somehow I made it, swinging through the door an instant before it slammed shut, the mechanism locking tight. The creature howled, a banshee&#x2019;s wail that made my skin crawl. I risked looking back through the bars, saw its huge bulk bounding past my cell, no skin to hide its grotesque muscles. There was a scream as it found another victim, but it didn&#x2019;t matter. I was safe. </p><p>For now.</p><p>&#x201c;That was close,&#x201d; said a voice behind me. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re getting good at this.&#x201d;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t answer, just stared out across the prison. Six stories of cells beneath me and God only knew how many more above my head, all buried deep underground. I felt like the weight of the world was pressing down on me, like I&#x2019;d been buried alive, and the panic began to set in. I closed my eyes, sucking in as much of the hot, stale air as I could, trying to picture the outside world, the sun, the ocean, my family.</p><p>All things I would never see again.</p><p>&#x201c;Yup,&#x201d; came the voice, my cellmate. &#x201c;Bet it&#x2019;s starting to feel like home already.&#x201d;</p><p>I opened my eyes and the prison was still there. Furnace Penitentiary. The place they send you to forget about you, to punish you for your crimes, even when you didn&#x2019;t commit them. Only one way in and no way out. Yeah, this was my home now, it would be until I died.</p><p>That wouldn&#x2019;t be long. Not with the gangs that eyeballed me from behind their bars.

With a new team of men forging through the wintry North Atlantic, and braving the cordon of the Royal Navy, Biddlecomb's seemingly simple mission is just the first volley in a grand scheme: to topple France's neutrality by gaining its vital support, and turn the colonial uprising into a full-scale world war for freedom.</p><p>James L.

Isaac Biddlecomb stood in the pouring rain, his shoes firmly fixed in the thick mud underfoot, the water running in three rivulets out of the corners of his cocked hat. His clothing was soaked through entirely, right down to his skin. He was more wet than he could recall ever having been while on land -- it could not be called dry land -- and had it been any later in the season, he might have been chilled as well, which would have made his discomfort complete.<br><br>Fortunately it was only the twenty-ninth of August, the end of the summer of 1776, and the evenings were still fairly warm in the former Crown colony of New York, which meant he was spared the misery of being both wet and cold.<br><br>He stood in the gathering dusk, confused and uncertain, while around him rushed dozens of men, hundreds of men, all of them even more confused and uncertain than he, an army apparently in full retreat. They were heavy laden with haversacks and cartridge boxes and soaked blankets tied in bundles, and they clutched muskets rendered useless by the rain.<br><br>"13th Pennsylvania, form up here! Form up!" a sergeant cried, waving his hat over his head to attract the attention of the men who streamed by, but no one paid any attention to him.<br><br>"Pardon me Biddlecomb took a step toward the sergeant, and as he did so, he was bumped hard from behind. He stumbled but his shoe stayed put, held fast in the mud, and his now stocking-clad foot came forward and sank inches deep in the muck. "Son of a bitch..."<br><br>"Keep clear, you stupid whoreson," said the man who had bumped him. The man rushed on past, bearing the head of a litter on which lay a soldier, thrashing and moaning, his formerly white breeches soaked with dirt, rain, and blood.<br><br>Biddlecomb extracted his foot from the mud, pushed it back into the shoe, and made his way over to the sergeant who had managed to round up three of the 13th Pennsylvania and was calling for more.<br><br>"Pardon me, pardon me, where might I find General Washington's staff?"<br><br>The sergeant did not look at him but jerked his thumb over his shoulder. "Tent, over yonder."<br><br>Biddlecomb looked in the direction the sergeant was pointing. A cluster of tents stood one hundred yards away, a group of smaller ones surrounding one much larger. They looked gray and indistinct through the rain and the failing light. "Thank you."<br><br>"If you see anyone of any rank worth piss," the sergeant said, meeting Biddlecomb's eyes, "tell him my men skirmished with some pickets that was thrown out in front of the sappers. Them saps are extending out northeasterly, about three hundred yards now, and they're still digging like fucking badgers."<br><br>"Yes, indeed..." Biddlecomb began to ask for an explanation of the sergeant's words, less than half of which he understood, but the man had returned to calling for his troops, so Biddlecomb left him and made his way toward the distant tent.<br><br>He was on the Brooklyn Heights, the high, wooded ridge that stood between the little town of Brooklyn, which he could see in glimpses through the trees down and to his right, and the rest of Long Island to his left. From where he stood he could just see the East River, but Manhattan Island and the harbor of New York were both lost in the poor visibility.<br><br>Still, he knew what was there. He knew that on Manhattan Island, behind hastily constructed fortifications, were huddled the few reserves from Washington's army, those who had not been thrown into the battle on Long Island. And he knew that in the harbor by Staten Island there were dozens of British transports, while just through the Narrows in Gowanus Bay were ten British ships of the line, twenty frigates, and hundreds more transports, the greatest expeditionary force ever mounted by the British military.<br><br>He had seen them both that morning, and had heard about the fleet beyond the Narrows, during a break in the weather, as he stood on the landing at the tip of Manhattan trying with great difficulty to find someone to ferry him across the river to Long Island.<br><br>It had taken him five days to get that far, five days from Philadelphia, which was not above ninety miles away.<br><br>The first part of the journey had been undertaken by coach, the coach that was supposed to go clear to Manhattan, crossing the Hudson at Jeffery's Hook, well north of the known British positions. The driver, however, had gone as far as Harlem and refused to go farther, swearing that he would not risk getting killed or having his horses requisitioned by plunging into the middle of a fight between them damnable German murderers and them godforsaken Whig rascals.<br><br>Biddlecomb had then been forced to walk the length of Manhattan Island, only to be stopped from his mission of seeing General Washington by the East River, which stood between him and the commander in chief.<br><br>"You don't want to go over there," said the soldier guarding the landing, turning and spitting into the East River in the general direction of Long Island. "Goddamned army's on the run. Goddamned Cornwallis marched right around the left flank, sent the bastards running. I'm just thanking the Good Lord that I ain't over there, and you should too."<br><br>But in point of fact Biddlecomb did want to go over there. He had come all of that way to see General Washington and he would not be stopped just short of accomplishing that.<br><br>Of course, when he had left Philadelphia, it had not occurred to him that he would find the general in the midst of such a crisis. After all, the British and the Americans had done nothing but stare at one another across New York Harbor for almost two months now. Only during his trip had he begun to hear disquieting rumors about British activity and the possibility of actual fighting. But he had not been dissuaded then and he would not be now.<br><br>A few hours short of nightfall, he managed to find a boat to take him across the fast-moving river.<br><br>And now, at long last, General Washington was in sight. Or General Washington's tent, at least.<br><br>He trudged on across the great expanse of mud that had once been a grassy field, pausing to let a column of men march past. They shuffled and muttered curses and their shoes made squishing sounds in the mud, but they possessed the closest thing to military order he had seen since reaching Long Island.<br><br>He could see the flare of a lantern being lit in the big tent, and then another, and soon the canvas glowed from within, an image of warmth and dryness. He looked at it longingly.<br><br>The column of men moved past and Biddlecomb continued on. He very much wanted to get in that tent and get some relief from the incessant rain, rain that he had endured with only brief respites for two solid days.<br>0 <br><br>He entered the cluster of tents and crossed, it seemed, some invisible divide. On the battlefield it was all confusion and disorganization, with wounded and frightened men rushing in panic. But in the cluster of tents a calm if urgent efficiency seemed to prevail. Messengers hurried in and out, and majors issued orders to captains, who issued orders to lieutenants, who moved frenetically through the headquarters. But there was no sense of panic, no sense of pending disaster. There was only the need to see things done, and quickly.<br><br>Biddlecomb paused outside the big tent, unsure whether he should enter. He took a breath and pushed the flap aside and stepped in, out of the driving rain and into the lantern light and the musty air within.<br><br>The tent was crammed with small tables, ringing the edges of the space, and at each sat a clerk scratching out copies of orders. Another dozen men at least milled around, talking in low tones, water running off their long cloaks and mixing with the mud with which the floor of the tent was evenly coated. And sitting at a big desk in the middle of the tent, enunciating orders to a lieutenant who stood before him, sat Maj. Edward Fitzgerald.<br><br>Biddlecomb pushed through the crowd of men and stood to one side of the desk, waiting for Fitzgerald to finish with the young officer. It had been almost a year since he had last seen the major, an aide-de-camp to General Washington. Fitzgerald had been instrumental in dispatching Biddlecomb to Bermuda to capture a British store of gunpowder in what had turned out to be nothing more than a plot to capture him.<br><br>The major had won no small degree of glory in driving off a British regiment that was attempting to take back the British merchantman that Biddlecomb had captured and brought into Boston Harbor, and though the major would not say as much, Biddlecomb also believed that the major had personally killed the traitor who had engineered the trap.<br><br>Fitzgerald was intelligent and charming, the loftiness of the Southern aristocracy coupled with a handsome face and athletic bearing. But despite those irritating qualities, they had become friends during Biddlecomb's time in Cambridge.<br><br>"Yes, I am in no doubt that Fort Putnam is well manned," Fitzgerald was saying to the lieutenant, "but you go and tell <i>General</i> Putnam that General Washington wants him to personally make certain there are troops clear to Wallabout Bay. That left flank must be anchored down thus or Cornwallis shall steal a march on us again. Now go."<br><br>The lieutenant swept off his hat in salute, then spun on his heel and was gone. Fitzgerald turned to Biddlecomb with an expression of a man ready to deal with yet another annoyance. Then he frowned and his eyebrows came together. "Isaac Biddlecomb? Capt. Isaac Biddlecomb, could it be? What in all hell...?"<br><br>He stood and extended his hand and Biddlecomb shook it with pleasure. "What in all the world are you doing here, sir?" Fitzgerald asked, smiling, quite in contrast to his expression of a moment before. "Of all the people I would have thought would have enough sense to keep clear of this debacle!"<br><br>"I'm...actually, I must have a word with General Washington."<br><br>"The general is out on the lines at the moment, left me here to deal with this nonsense."<br><br>"I understand things have not gone well these past days?"<br><br>Fitzgerald smiled. "You could say that. General Sullivan failed to hold the Jamaica Pass. Hell, he failed to even try to hold it. Cornwallis marched right around our left flank, and before we knew it, his whole damned army was in our rear. It was a rout. They drove us clear back to the Heights with the damned East River at our backs. We lost a great deal of men, good men."<br><br>"Sir? Sir?" A drenched, muddy soldier stepped up to Fitzgerald's desk and saluted. His cheek was smeared with blood that was diluted to a thin red wash by the rain. "Corporal Mulligan, sir, 13th Pennsylvania. Lieutenant says for me to report to you that we had a skirmish with some pickets protecting the sappers, sir. The saps is three hundred yards long now, extending northeast, and they're still digging."<br><br>"Thank you, Corporal," Fitzgerald said, and the soldier saluted again and left.<br><br>"Oh, yes," said Biddlecomb with a flush of guilt, "what does all that mean?"<br><br>"General Howe is digging regular approaches to get at us. By that I mean saps...trenches...and breastworks, getting his troops closer."<br><br>"But it appeared to me as if the Continental Army was in full retreat. Are the British not in close pursuit?"<br><br>"What? Oh, do you mean the men out there? No, they are just stragglers, wounded men or men separated from their companies or skulkers. The main part of the army is still well entrenched. Please, Captain, have a seat." Fitzgerald gestured toward a chair in front of his desk. Biddlecomb sat and Fitzgerald did too.<br><br>"And Cornwallis is digging approaches?" Biddlecomb asked. "I should think he would prefer a headlong assault, with his greater numbers."<br><br>"Apparently he had a bellyful of frontal attacks at Bunker's Hill and we can thank the Lord for that. Had he pressed his attack of the other day, he would have overrun us. He still could, especially in this rain, as we have precious few bayonets amongst us. Fortunately he does not seem inclined to try. But tell me, how has it been with you? I heard some of the captains were court-martialed for that affair with the <i>Glasgow?</i> I would wish you were not one of them."<br><br>"I was not," said Biddlecomb. The affair to which Fitzgerald alluded was a night battle, one that pitted the entire American fleet, two ships, three brigs, and a sloop, against the British frigate <i>Glasgow.</i> And despite the overwhelming odds the <i>Glasgow</i> had managed to inflict considerable damage and then escape.<br><br>"Apparently my chasing the <i>Glasgow</i> nearly into Newport, as stupid and ill-considered as it was, was thought valiant enough to put me above suspicion. It was Whipple that was court-martialed, at his own request, to quash the bloody stupid talk of cowardice that had started. If ever there was a man who was not a coward, it is Abraham Whipple. He was acquitted of course. Hazard of the <i>Providence</i> was cashiered, as well he should have been. Hopkins was just censured by Congress a few weeks ago."<br><br>Fitzgerald nodded. "So the fleet is still in Providence?"<br><br>"For the most part. The first on <i>Alfred,</i> a Scotsman by the name of Jones, has command of <i>Providence</i> now in Hazard's stead and he has been cruising, as has <i>Andrew Doria</i> and <i>Cabot.</i> I have mostly been tied up with business in Philadelphia."<br><br>"Not so tied up, I should hope, that you have been unable to see Virginia? Virginia Stanton?"<br><br>Biddlecomb smiled at that. Virginia was the daughter of his mentor, William Stanton. He had been courting her, to the extent that his time ashore and his courage would allow, for almost two years. Fitzgerald had met her, during the Bermuda affair, and Biddlecomb was not insensible to the effect that she had had on him. She had that effect on most men.<br><br>"Yes, I have seen her," said Biddlecomb, "though I fear you mistake her name. She is no longer Virginia Stanton. She now goes by the name Virginia Biddlecomb."<br><br>At that, Fitzgerald's fine-tailored composure fell apart, to Biddlecomb's delight. The major sat forward and his mouth hung open. "I...I...," he stammered while Biddlecomb leaned back and folded his arms, savoring the moment.<br><br>And then he was back in Philadelphia, a hot, humid July day. And then he was back in her bed, their bed, her lithe body moving under him, and despite the heavy, soaked clothing he felt a warmth inside, the beginnings of arousal.<br><br>"Well, man, congratulations!" Fitzgerald said at last, his usual cool demeanor returning. "You are married? Why, you lucky dog! I am with child to hear the particulars, though I fear this is not the time or place."<br><br>"Indeed." Biddlecomb shook his head, like shaking off comforting sleep. He was again aware of the pelting of rain on the roof of General Washington's tent as he stared at the flame in the lantern, flickering and dancing in the many and conflicting drafts. "Forgive my distraction, I beg. I find the memory more pleasing by far than the present circumstance."<br><br>"Of course you do. I do too, and ...</p><h2>Puccini: A Listener&#39;s Guide (Unlocking the Masters)</h2><p>In this comprehensive exploration of Puccini&#39;s most beloved operas, on the 150th anniversary of his birth, John Bell Young celebrates some of the most moving music ever composed.

The streets burst with filthy life; rats and flies and the sneering, diseased poor of the Empire. Carts piled with everything from sausages to silks poured through the gates, choked the narrow alleyways, jammed into the forums. Exotic crowds from the edges of the world shoved and brawled and stole in every corner. Over it all a blue haze of smoke from countless sausage-stands and bakeries hung like dead fog. Rome was drowning in humanity: naked slaves, nobility preceded by lictors and followed by streams of clients, soldiers in creaking leather and clanging brass, aristocratic ladies held above the mass on litters, all surging around the gaudily painted temples of government, religion and wealth. </p><p> She drove her chariot like a centurion. Two slaves walked ahead of the horse and chariot with whips to force the crowd aside -- she didn't give a damn how it made her look, she had no time for the effete ministrations of lictors with their delicate rods. She was in a hurry and Rome was just going to have to move. </p><p> As she proceeded along the Nova Via toward the Appian Way the crowds thinned somewhat; nobody was going out the Capenian Gate today. </p><p> The lush palaces on the Palatine Hill and the brightly painted Temple of Apollo disappeared behind her. Now her slaves were trotting. Soon she would flail her horse and burst past them. She was growing frantic, the heat made time short. </p><p> On this day she would find one of the strongest men on earth and make him her own. She passed under the Appian Aqueduct and through the Capenian Gate. Now that she was outside she thrashed the horse, rattling past the Temple of Honor and Virtue and over a little hill. With shocking suddenness the horror was before her. </p><p> Even in this age of cheap life it stunned her. </p><p> A dense, roaring mass of flies darkened the sun. Lining the Appian Way for miles, rising and falling over the gentle Campagnian Hills, were twin rows of crosses. The entire army of the slave rebel called Spartacus was being executed. They had been here for three days. The question was, could she find one still living? </p><p> Such a man would have to be incredibly strong. Miriam's father had theorized that selecting only the very strongest might be the solution to their problem. In the past they had too often chosen badly, and the transformed had always died. </p><p> Miriam needed this man. She longed for him, dreamed about him. And now she arranged her veils to keep out the flies and prodded her horse to find him. The shadows of morning stretched before the crosses. At least Miriam was alone on the road; travelers were detouring along the Ardenian Way as far as Capua in order to avoid this disgusting mess. Miriam's slaves came up behind her, gasping from their run out from the city, batting at the flies that settled around them. Her horse snorted nervously as flies alighted on its face. </p><p> "Groom," she said, motioning with her hand. Her slaves had wrapped themselves in cotton soaked with gall. The groom came forward. For an instant his costume reminded her of better times, when she had watched the people of the desert going forth in the sun with similar turbans on their heads. In those days her family had been nomadic, traveling up and down the desert, capturing strays on the fringes of Egypt's fertile plain. </p><p> She moved slowly ahead, enduring the sweet stench and the ceaseless energy of the flies, past corpse after corpse. A knot of loathing burned in her stomach. Rome was madness enthroned. And it would get worse. The city's rise to a world-empire was now inevitable. In time it would pass, but not soon. Many hard years lay ahead. </p><p> Every few minutes she stopped, lifted her veils, and stared long at one of the victims. With a flick of her wrist she would send a slave to test him by prodding him in the ribs with a stick. A feeble groan would be the only protest and she would continue on. Behind her one of her slaves had begun to play a flute to soften the ordeal. He played the plaintive music of Egypt, sad notes well suited to the situation. </p><p> She noticed one man from a long way off and stopped a moment to watch him. There was organization to his movements. Tied to a cross, a man must keep his legs straight or suffocate. To stay alive takes every human resource. Only sheer terror of death keeps a man struggling on a cross. </p><p> This man must have been at it steadily for nearly seventy-two hours. Yet he must realize that nobody was going to have mercy on him. </p><p> She clapped softly to signal the groom. It was all she could do not to whip the horse to a gallop, but then her slaves would have to run again. She was no Roman, she despised indifferent cruelty. So they walked to the prize. As they drew closer she saw that he was Greek or Middle Eastern, filthy and brutally wounded from whipping. His eyes were closed, his face almost peaceful in the extremity of his effort. </p><p> The next moment he straightened his legs and she heard an awful, ponderous intake of breath. Then the legs slacked again. One eye had opened a little, staring down at the approaching observers. But he was beyond caring about them, all his energy was devoted to his struggle. </p><p> He did it again without a cry or moan, and settled as quickly as he had risen. Then she noticed that his feet were moving back and forth beneath their seething mass of flies. He was actually trying to loosen his bonds! </p><p> And the flies were eating the blood on his ankles. </p><p> "Demetrius, Brusus, take him down!" </p><p> Two of her slaves ran to the cross and began shaking it, removing it from the ground. The man on the cross grimaced, showing his teeth. </p><p> "Be careful, you're hurting him." </p><p> They lowered the cross and she dismounted her chariot and ran to him. She ignored a distant noise, the clatter of hooves. There was no time to worry about soldiers now. She had gall and vinegar, and bathed his face with the liquids while the slaves untied him. The damage was appalling, there were even nests of maggots in his ears. His skin was cracked and black, his body bloated. Only the shallow rattling breath told her that he lived -- that and the open eye. </p><p> He stared at her. She spoke as soothingly to him as she would to a son. The eye unsettled her. It was incredible that he could be so alert after such an ordeal. </p><p> "My Lady -- " one of her slaves whispered. </p><p> She looked up. Standing like sentinels of death were three soldiers with drawn short swords. They were in the middle of the road, almost hidden by the clouds of flies. These soldiers guarded the crosses, their mission to see that nobody took down any of the condemned. Not a few might try. Motives were many -- relatives, sympathizers, slavers after the quick profits of contraband. </p><p> "Get him to the chariot -- be quick!" </p><p> He groaned when he was moved. Her slaves laid him with his knees to his chin on the floor of the chariot. There was no time to lose; even as she stepped up and grabbed the reins, the soldiers were coming forward. "Tell them I'm Crassus' wife," she said to her groom. The lie would make them hesitate. Roman soldiers would never impede the activities of the wife of Rome's current dictator. She snapped the reins and the horse broke into a gallop. She would allow it to gallop back to Rome; by now Victrix was desperate to return to her stall. As for the six slaves, they would make their way home more slowly. No doubt they would convince the soldiers of their innocence, they were sophisticated Egyptians and the troopers were only simple boys from Latium. </p><p> The man screamed when the chariot jerked and Miriam screamed with him. He was such an incredible find, it would be utterly desolating to kill him while trying to save him. </p><p> She had searched half the world for a man such as this, who clutched life with every whisper of strength. </p><p> They reached the Temple of Mars and she swung off the Appian Way. There was no sense in returning through the Capenian Gate; it would be certain to arouse the suspicion of the guard. She drove around the temple on a carter's track, moving close beneath the city wall. There were huts and holes in the shadow of the wall, and the track was stinking and awash in sewage. Floating in it were corpses in every state of decomposition. Dozens of people of every race on earth huddled on both sides of the track, migrants who had come to Rome only to find that strict laws controlled their right to enter the city. If they were not citizens, enrolled freedmen or slaves they could not pass through the gates. A woman came forward brandishing a stick. Miriam showed the short sword that was scabbarded on the chariot. Most of these people were extremely weak and would be unable to subdue her, much less stop the horse. </p><p> There was a motionless mass of carts and wagons at the Naevian Gate. Miriam whipped the horse ahead. It was best to take advantage of any confusion. </p><p> She used her voice and her whip liberally, thrashing carters and their horses out of the way and making the soldiers guarding the gate roar with laughter. Nevertheless, her efforts got her through quickly, and the condition of her passenger made her desperate for haste. Nobody looked into the bundle on the floor of the chariot. </p><p> She passed the Circus Maximus and wheeled toward the Quadrata, an area of wealthy mansions and luxurious insulae. Miriam owned the Insula Ianiculensis and lived on the ground floor. Her upstairs rents paid her taxes and left her enough to maintain her apartments, a villa at Herculaneum and fifty slaves. Hers was a modestly well-to-do establishment, comfortable enough but unlikely to attract any notice. </p><p> She found her way through the labyrinth of side streets behind the Circus. Soon the Aemilian Bridge appeared and she crossed it into the stillness of the Quadrata. At this time of year the suburb was quiet, its inhabitants away at Capua or Pompeii for the summer. </p><p> At last she arrived at the Insula Ianiculensis. As soon as she came around the corner slaves rushed out, a stable boy taking the reins of the exhausted horse as the assistant master of conveyances stepped up to the chariot. Her Egyptian physicians came forward and took the crucified man into the house. She followed, not stopping even as the maid of the outer garments fumbled with her fibula and removed her fly-spotted cloak. They crossed the Atrium and went through the Peristyle with its flowers and lotus-filled pool and beyond into the suite of baths which had been converted into a hospital in anticipation of this arrival. </p><p> At her instructions the tepidarium had been salted and the frigidarium filled with equal parts water and vinegar. A bed had been installed in the solarium with a movable awning above it. Supplies of medicinals and such chemicals as saltpeter and alum had been brought in. Miriam would use all her medical knowledge -- far more extensive than that of the idiotic Graeco-Roman "doctors" -- in her effort to nurse the man back to health. She had learned medicine in Egypt, combining the ancient knowledge of her own people with that of the priestly cults. </p><p> She waved away the bath attendants, who were trying to wash her face and arms, and told the physicians to lay their burden on the bed. The three of them had worked for her long enough to follow her orders without argument; they considered themselves students in her service. </p><p> Only now, with the sunlight full on his naked body, did she really feel the presence of this man. Despite his wounds and sores he was magnificent, fully six feet tall with huge shoulders and arms, but surprisingly delicate hands. His face was covered with stubble; he was perhaps twenty years old. </p><p> The Romans had been as vicious as ever. Hardly any unmarked skin remained. Suddenly, he made a rasping sound and began to heave weakly on the bed. She lifted him by the shoulders, her fingers breaking through to the blood-wet skin beneath the scabs, and held his head between his legs. Great black masses came from his mouth. </p><p> "Gall him," she said. "He stopped breathing!" </p><p> With a funnel the physicians forced the sourest gall down his throat. He retched and gasped and vomited more, but when she lay him back down he was breathing again. </p><p> She had him soaked in the hot salt water and sat forcing cold fruit juice down his throat while the bath attendants scummed the water. Afterward her physicians rubbed into his wounds an ointment she had prepared from the fungus Aspergillus. Then they soaked him in the frigidarium and gave him hot Falernian wine. </p><p> He slept twenty hours. </p><p> For much of this time she sat at the head of his bed listening to his breathing. When he awoke he ate six dates and drank off a flagon of beer. </p><p> His second sleep lasted fifteen hours. He awoke at three in the morning, screaming. </p><p> She stroked his face, made soft sounds in her throat. "Am I dead?" he asked before lapsing once again into unconsciousness. His sleep, deeper than ever, continued until morning. Miriam saw that he had swollen to bursting. He looked like a wineskin. His flesh glowed red through the fissures opened up by the stretching skin. </p><p> He stank of death. His body grew hot and dry and she had him moved to the frigidarium. He became delirious, speaking elegant Greek, talking of the Attic Hills. She knew those hills, had watched evening purple them from the Akropolis of Athens. She knew also those breezes of which he spoke, fragrant with hymettus, bearing the music of shepherd's pipes. </p><p> A long time ago she had walked there, when Athens was the center of the world. In those days the huddled confusion of empire lay at Athens' gates, when her blue-sailed ships called at all the ports of the East. In such a place as that -- or this -- Miriam could most easily go about her business. </p><p> Against the expectations of her physicians the swelling subsided and the fever declined. Soon he could raise his head for wine or broth of Aspergillus, or the boiled blood of chickens and pigs. She knew his name from his ramblings of his delirium, and one day when she called "Eumenes," he smiled. </p><p> She spent hours gazing at him. As his wounds healed he became more and more beautiful. She taught her cosmetician to shave him and, when he was well enough to sit up, went out and bought him a body servant and a boy of his own. </p><p> Slowly a new feeling began to fill her. She ordered artisans in to mosaic the floors and paint the walls, just to give the house a fresh appearance, to fit the new mood. She clothed Eumenes in the finest silks, like a Babylonian prince. She dressed his hair with unguents and applied ocher to his eyes. When he was strong enough she converted the whole Peristyle into a gymnasium and hired professional trainers for him. </p><p> Her own beauty blossomed as never before. Her male slaves became awkward and silly in her presence, and if she kissed them they blushed. </p><p> No household in Rome could have been happier, no woman more gay. Soon Eumenes was strong enough to walk, and they began to venture from the Insula. Pompey filled the Flaminian Circus with water and ordered mock sea-battles for the entertainment of the public. They spent a day in a private box, d...</p></p><h2>Thriller Diller (The 3 Investigators Crimebusters #6)</h2><p>The seventeen-year-old Investigators try to locate a film star kidnapped during the filming of a horror movie</p><p>Grade 5-7-- Pete Crenshaw has assisted his friends Jupiter Jones and Bob Andrews on so many cases as a junior detective that he's sure he can single-handedly solve the mystery of Diller Rourke, a horror-film star who fails to report to : the set of his latest picture. When the film's producer finally receives a ransom note, Pete welcomes his friends' involvement. As in previous "Three Investigators" mysteries, this case abounds with suspicious characters, red-herring clues, dangerous situations, and cliff-hanger chapter endings. The routinely satisfying solution results in the bad guys being exposed, the detectives' skills being recognized, and the feeling that all is once again right in southern California. --Ann G.

They`re both popular, smart, and gorgeous, but that's where the similarity ends. Elizabeth is friendly, outgoing, and sincere -- nothing like her snobbish and conniving twin. Jessica gets what she wants -- at school, with friends, and especially with boys.<br><br>This time, Jessica has set her sights on Todd Wilkins, the handsome star of the basketball team -- the one boy that Elizabeth really likes. Elizabeth doesn't want to lose him, but what Jessica wants, Jessica usually gets... even if it ends up hurting her sister.<br><br>Meet the Wakefield twins, their guys, and the rest of the gang at Sweet Valley High....</p><p>Chapter<br>1<br>"Okay, when did I get so hideous?" Jessica Wakefield groaned. She leaned in toward her bedroom mirror as her twin sister, Elizabeth, rolled her eyes. "Seriously, Liz, it's like somebody snuck into my room last night and whacked me with the ugly stick."<br>"Yeah. That happened," Elizabeth said, digging through a pile of clothes on Jessica's bed.<br>"I'm totally serious!" Jessica protested. "First of all, I gained, like, five pounds since last week-all in my hips and butt," she said, turning around and craning her neck to see her rear view in the mirror. Her perfect-size-four rear view. "And I hate my hair. I mean, that new shampoo I bought did none of the things it was supposed to do. I'm all split ends and frizz."<br>"Uh-huh," Liz said disinterestedly.<br>"Plus I've got a zit! A huge one! Look at this thing, Liz! It's the zit that ate Sweet Valley!"<br>Jessica got right up in her sister's face.<br>"You're right, Jess," Liz said flatly. "You're completely deformed. You should definitely stay home from school today."<br>Jessica's face crumpled and she collapsed face-first on her unmade bed. "You suck."<br>"What? I'm just agreeing with you."<br>"Fine. Just leave me here to rot. I'm not fit for normal society."<br>Elizabeth laughed and pulled her sister back up, maneuvering her in front of the mirror, where they stood side by side. With their shoulder-length blond hair, blue-green eyes, and perfect California tans, Elizabeth and Jessica were exact duplicates of one another, down to the tiny dimples in their left cheeks when they smiled. Each wore a gold lavaliere around her neck-matching presents from their parents on their sixteenth birthday last June. The only way anyone who didn't know them very well could tell them apart was by the tiny beauty mark on Elizabeth's right shoulder. Those who did know them well knew that Elizabeth's style was more sophisticated and preppy, while Jessica's was up-to-the-minute trendy. Plus Elizabeth always wore a watch, while Jessica did not. Time was never a problem for Jessica. She always felt that things didn't really start until she arrived.<br>"Look at me," Elizabeth said to her twin, who did as she was told. "Now look at you." Jessica did. "If you're hideous, then I'm hideous too. Are you calling me hideous?"<br>Jessica's brow knitted. "You're a freak, you know that?"<br>"Yeah. A freak who can't find her new white sweater," Elizabeth said, returning to her search. "Where did you say you put it?"<br>Jessica hadn't said. Because she'd worn it without asking and spilled marinara sauce down the front, then forgotten to wash it right away. The stain had set, and now the sweater was ruined beyond all hope. She was just opening her mouth to plead ignorance when the phone rang.<br>"I got it!" she cried, grabbing the phone from her bedside table. "Hello?"<br>She took the phone out into the hallway to avoid her sister's growing impatience. Why didn't the girl just give up already and wear something else? Liz could be so stubborn sometimes.<br>"Hey, Liz? Or is this Jessica?" a boy's voice asked.<br>"It's Jessica," she replied. Hmmm. A call from a guy before the first school bell had rung. Her day was looking up already.<br>"Oh, hey, Jess. It's Todd."<br>Todd Wilkins? Even better. Todd was one of the most coveted guys in school. Tall, dark, and yum.<br>"Hey. What's up?" she asked, leaning back against the wall with a smile. Jessica had never really considered Todd before, but hey, if he was calling her, maybe he deserved a spare thought. Or two.<br>"Not much. Is Liz there?" he asked.<br>Instantly, the smile was gone. He was calling for Liz? The star wide receiver of the football team, captain of the basketball team, a shoo-in for best-looking and most popular, was calling for her brainiac sister? What was this, some kind of reality-show prank?<br>&nbsp;"Actually, she's kind of busy right now," Jessica said, taking a few steps away from her bedroom. "Spell-checking her latest marathon paper, of course. Such a nerd. So, how's the team? I saw that insane catch you made at practice the other day. ESPN highlight reel all the way."<br>Get him talking about himself, Jessica thought. Guys love that.<br>"You saw that?" The blush was evident in Todd's voice. Jessica glowed with triumph.<br>"Are you kidding? I practically missed my dismount because of it," Jessica told him. "Didn't you hear me cheering? I stopped practice and everything." It also couldn't hurt to remind him that she was captain of the cheerleading squad that went all out to support him every week.<br>"Thanks. That's . . . uh . . . thanks," Todd stammered.<br>"Can't wait for the first game," Jessica said happily. She just loved to make guys nervous. "I bet you'll have college scouts coming out for you in no time."<br>"I don't know about that, but thanks," Todd said humbly.<br>Jessica smiled. Sometimes she was so good she could hardly believe it herself. Two seconds of flattery and the guy had forgotten all about Liz. Boys were so predictable.<br>"Anyway, do you think you could see if Liz is free yet?" he asked.<br>Jessica frowned. Okay, maybe not totally predictable. "Oh, you know what? She just got in the shower."<br>"I could wait," Todd said hopefully.<br>Jessica forced a laugh. "Are you kidding? She'll be <br>in there forever. Liz takes the longest showers." Big <br>lie. Jessica was actually the hot-water hog of the family. In fact, Elizabeth usually had to take short showers because the hot water stopped half a minute in, thanks to Jessica.<br>Todd took a deep breath. "All right, then. I guess I'll just . . . talk to her later. Could you tell her I called?"<br>"No problem!" Jessica said. "See you in school!"<br>"Yeah. See ya."<br>Jessica hung up the phone and rolled her eyes. Todd Wilkins calling for Liz? What a joke. Elizabeth probably didn't even know Todd existed. She was way too serious for a gorgeous athlete like him.<br>"Who was that?" Elizabeth asked when Jessica traipsed back into her room. She had two neatly folded piles of Jessica's clothes in front of her now-clothes that had been strewn all over the room five minutes ago.<br>"Todd Wilkins," Jessica replied, tossing the phone onto her bed. "I don't know why he didn't call my cell. I'm sure he has the number."<br>Elizabeth paused midfold. "Todd called you?"<br>"Yeah. Guess he just couldn't wait another half hour to talk to me in school," Jessica said with a shrug, turning toward her reflection again.<br>"Oh." Elizabeth attacked another mountain of clothes, tearing through them like a tornado.<br>"Liz? What's wrong?" Jessica asked, staring at her sister in the mirror. She was whipping clothes at the bed as if they'd somehow offended her.<br>"What's wrong is I wish you'd stop taking my stuff without asking," Elizabeth blurted out.<br>Jessica rolled her eyes as she turned around. "So borrow something of mine if you want. I have white sweaters too, you know."<br>"That's not the point," Elizabeth said, irritated.<br>"Then what is the point?" Jessica asked.<br>"The point is . . . ," Elizabeth said, looking around at the mess. "The point is . . ." Finally, her shoulders slumped. She took a deep breath and sighed. "Just forget it. I'll wear something else."<br>She turned and walked out of Jessica's room, stepping over a pile of stuff on the way out the door. Jessica shook her head at her sister's back as she went. Liz really was way too possessive of her things.<br>Todd Wilkins. Huh, Jessica thought. We would look pretty hot together.<br>With one last fluff of her hair and a quick, appreciative glance at her reflection-hideousness forgotten-Jessica grabbed her books and headed downstairs for breakfast. There was nothing that put her in a good mood faster than the thought of a brand-new conquest.</p><h2>The President&#39;s Daughter (Sean Dillon)</h2><p>Twenty years after his affair with a beautiful Frenchwoman in Vietnam, Jake Cazalet finds out he has a daughter. He must keep it a secret--but years later, when he is President of the United States, someone discovers the truth.<p>Ans when his only child is kidnapped by a terrorist group, he must count on British operative Sean Dillon and FBI agent Blake Johnson to find her.</p></p><p><i>The President's Daughter</i> is to thrillers what Hong Kong is to movies: hyperphysical and flashy, filled with international menace, and perfectly choreographed so there's no wasted action whatsoever. And like those movies, the book's a wonderful ride, particularly if you don't ask too many questions after you climb aboard. The characters are strictly Central Casting: a gallant war-hero president twitted by terrorists, a craggy old pro called out of retirement, an I.R.A. scoundrel with a heart of ... well, brass at least. The daughter of the title is a comely French countess (of course), who's kidnapped by a nefarious group of Israeli extremists. In return for her safety, they want Dad to nuke several Arab countries. Will he be forced to push the button, or will a trio of agents be able to reach her in time? Typical of the genre, the book's pull is the intelligence of the villains multiplied by the ingenuity of the heroes. <i>The President's Daughter</i> scores highly on both and readers itching for a globe-trotting game of cat-and-rat won't be disappointed.Jack Higgins lives on Jersey in the Channel Islands.</p><h2>Bad Bear Detectives</h2><p>When a shipment of imported Italian muffins goes missing, Irving and Muktuk become the key suspects. Everyone knows their weakness for muffins and immediately think they are responsible!<br><br>Irving and Muktuk realize that in order to clear their smirched names, they have to find the culprit themselves. They disguise themselves, sniff out some clues, interview possible witnesses, and try to find the thief. As with all good mysteries, the clues lead to a surprise ending.</p><p>Daniel Pinkwater is crazy about writing, and has been trying to learn how to do it for fifty years. He has written about a hundred books, all but two or three of them good. People who own radios may know Daniel Pinkwater as a popular commentator and children&#x2019;s book reviewer on National Public Radio. At one time, he lived in Los Angeles, went to a fancy private school with the children of movie stars, and ate in The Hat numerous times. He lives with his wife, the illustrator and novelist Jill Pinkwater, and several dogs and cats in a very old farmhouse in New York&#x2019;s Hudson River Valley.Grade 1-3&#x2013;Irving and Muktuk are accused of stealing a shipment of blueberry muffins that was stored in a waterfront warehouse. The two polar bears swear tearfully that they are innocent, but, as they set out to prove it, they seem more and more suspect. To look like detectives, they steal hats from the Zoo Director and go in search of clues. As they sniff their way closer to the truth, their memory gets jogged concerning the actual nature of events. Kids will love the cartoon drawings rendered in felt-tip marker and ink. The white bears outlined in black ink, one wearing a red hat, the other a yellow one, contrast delightfully with a midnight-blue sky and colorful city buildings as they stride through the streets. This charming mystery will have kids guessing. This story is great for independent mid-level readers and as a read-aloud.<i>&#x2013;Wanda Meyers-Hines, Ridgecrest Elementary School, Huntsville, AL</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Innes was educated at Oriel College, Oxford, where he was presented with the Matthew Arnold Memorial Prize and named a Bishop Frazer&#39;s scholar. After graduation, he went to Vienna to study Freudian psychoanalysis for a year and following his first book, an edition of Florio&#39;s translation of &#39;Montaigne&#39;, was offered a lectureship at the University of Leeds. In 1932 he married Margaret Hardwick, a doctor, and they subsequently had five children including Angus, also a novelist. The year 1936 saw Innes as Professor of English at the University of Adelaide, during which tenure he wrote his first mystery story, &#39;Death at the President&#39;s Lodging&#39;. With his second, &#39;Hamlet Revenge&#39;, Innes firmly established his reputation as a highly entertaining and cultivated writer. After the end of World War II, he returned to the UK and spent two years at Queen&#39;s University, Belfast, where in 1949 he wrote the &#39;Journeying Boy&#39;, a novel notable for the richly comedic use of an Irish setting. He then settled down as a Reader in English Literature at Christ Church, Oxford, from which he retired in 1973. Innes&#39;s most famous character is &#39;John Appleby&#39;, who inspired a penchant for donnish detective fiction that lasts to this day. His other well-known character is &#39;Honeybath&#39;, the painter and rather reluctant detective, who first appeared in 1975 in &#39;The Mysterious Commission&#39;. The last of the Innes novels, &#39;Appleby and the Ospreys&#39;, was published in 1986, some eight years before his death in 1994. His work is still very highly regarded and &#39;Appleby&#39;s End&#39; and &#39;The New Sonia Wayward&#39; were chosen by H.R.F. Keating as being amongst the best 100 crime novels ever written. The &#39;Times Literary Supplement&#39; said of him: &#39;A Master - he constructs a plot that twists and turns like an electric eel: it gives you shock upon shock and you cannot let go.&#39;<p>'Remarkable for strong and clear characterisation and&#x2013;those distinctive qualities of the detection tale'</p></p><h2>Patti Smith: American Artist</h2><p>A stunning collection of photographs from Frank Stefanko featuring the Godmother of Punk herself, iconic musician-turned-author Patti Smith. -Frank always shot your internal life. He let your external imperfections show. His photos had a purity and poetry; there was some humor . . .- --Bruce Springsteen Patti Smith was a favorite photographic subject for Frank Stefanko during his college years. -Patti had jet-black hair and pale blue eyes that could see right through you. When I visited New York, I started photographing Patti. I was captivated by her look . . . tall, thin, with porcelain skin, sharp features, and those piercing eyes. With me, in terms of portraits, it&#39;s always the eyes first, then the rest of the face comes into view.- Patti Smith came to prominence during the punk rock movement in the 1970s, with her highly regarded 1975 debut album, Horses. She has been called -punk rock&#39;s poet laureate- because of her feminist sensibilities and intellectual approach to her music. As a result, she is one of rock and roll&#39;s most influential female musicians and according to Rolling Stone, one of -The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.- Among some of Patti Smith&#39;s early influences were Robert Mapplethorpe, Jim Carroll, and Tom Verlaine. She spent the early 1970s painting, writing, and performing spoken-word poetry--frequently at the St. Mark&#39;s Poetry Project. By 1974, she was performing as a musician, initially with guitarist and rock archivist Lenny Kaye. The Patti Smith Group produced four albums in the 1970s, reaching #13 on Billboard&#39;s Top 100 in 1978 with the single -Because The Night, - cowritten with Smith&#39;s friend Bruce Springsteen.</p><p>Author of <i>Days of Hopes and Dreams: An Intimate Portrait of Bruce Springsteen</i>, Frank Stefanko is a fine art photographer whose work graces the album covers of Bruce Springsteen&#x2019;s <i>Darkness on the Edge of Town</i> and <i>The River</i>. Stefanko&#x2019;s portfolio includes vintage and contemporary photographs of The Rolling Stones, Rod Stewart, Janis Joplin, Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention, Bette Midler, Johnny Winters, as well as Bruce and Patti. Frank Stefanko grew up near the working class neighborhood of Bruce Springsteen, and was first introduced to the performer in 1978 by their mutual friend Patti Smith. He lives in New Jersey. <br>Guitarist, composer and writer Lenny Kaye was a member of the <i>Patti Smith Group</i>, and has been Smith&#x2019;s most frequent collaborator. He is also the co-author of Waylon Jennings&#x2019; autobiography, <i>Waylon: An Autobiography.</i> <br>Patti Smith is a musician, singer, and poet. On July 10, 2005, Smith was named a Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters by the French Ministry, honored for her influence on rock and roll and her appreciation for Arthur Rimbaud.</p><h2>Blood+ Kowloon Nights</h2><p>In his years as a Hong Kong police officer, Nishi Tatsuyoshi has never seen murder victims like the ones being found in the abandoned Kowloon Walled City. Bodies completely drained of blood are showing up every few nights, and rumors of vampires are swirling. The closer Nishi gets to the truth, the more obstacles are thrown in his way. Someone doesn&#39;t want him to discover what&#39;s really going on! Forced into an uneasy alliance with the Chiropteran-hunting Red Shield organization, Nishi works with a mysterious cello player named Hagi as they try to uncover the source of the murders and bring down the Wong family - which peddles a miracle drug they claim will give users immortality!</p><p></p><h2>Walk in the Spirit</h2><p>This Bible based study by Gloria Copeland will point you in the direction God has mapped out for today&#39;s believer so that you might confidently Walk in the Spirit.</p><p></p><h2>Be Ever Hopeful, Hannalee (A Troll Book)</h2><p>In 1865 with the war recently over, fourteen-year-old Hannalee and her recently reunited family decide to start a new life in Atlanta where, because of the need to rebuild the devastated city, jobs are plentiful. Sequel to &#34;Turn Homeward, Hannalee.&#34;</p><p>Grade 5-8 This sequel begins exactly where Turn Homeward, Hannalee (Morrow, 1984) ended. A preface explains what has gone before, but those who skip it will be able to enjoy this book thoroughly. Hannalee's brother Davey has returned from war without an arm, intent upon moving the family to Atlanta to begin a new life. Hannalee's strength of character and optimism continue to serve her family well, particularly when she finds a job in a dry goods store in order to help support them. When Davey is jailed for murder, Hannalee is able to prove, with the help of a frightened former slave, that her brother is innocent. This fast-paced historical novel chronicles the post Civil War period from the point of view of the Southern white working class who never owned slaves. There is an afterward which describes the historical background upon which this story is based. It is fascinating reading, but like prefaces, afterwards are unfortunately often left unread. Readers will enjoy Hannalee's adventures, her strong love and loyalty to her family, and the start of her first romance. Janet E.

More disturbing: A horse soon returns without its rider. Gregory Luckham, a controversial presence as the president of a powerful energy company pushing for a pipeline through central Virginia, is the missing hunter.

She loved being a master, making decisions, solving problems. She did not love braiding, however.<br><br>&#x201c;I can do that for you.&#x201d; Tootie Harris, early twenties, a whipper-in, offered.<br><br>&#x201c;I know you can, Angel, but I think I should braid my own horse.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Arthritis.&#x201d; Her huntsman, Shaker Crown, braiding his horse, teased her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m starting to get it. Anyway, I thought this is what children are for, braiding.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You know, he has a point.&#x201d; Betty was standing on her low stool to reach the mane, a small bit of thick mane between her fingers, the clipped yarn in her mouth, which she took out to speak.<br><br>&#x201c;Think it will be a lot of people tomorrow?&#x201d; Weevil, the new, gorgeous, male whipper-in, hailing from Canada, asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Weevil, usually is.&#x201d; Sister climbed back up on the stool. &#x201c;Matador is standing nicely for you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s a good boy with a silky mane. Makes it easy,&#x201d; the handsome blond replied.<br><br>&#x201c;Just think, everyone who will hunt tomorrow is doing as we&#x2019;re doing. I like to think of that, all of us trying to make our horses beautiful for Christmas Hunt,&#x201d; Betty said.<br><br>The large end stable doors opened, Sam Lorillard with Rory Boone came in, shutting the doors behind them.<br><br>Sam pulled off his lumberjack cap. &#x201c;Cold out there. Got off work early.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Cold enough in here.&#x201d; Shaker tugged at Showboat&#x2019;s mane with a short metal comb.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re here to polish the tack. If you all are determined to braid your horses, we might as well get working on the tack.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The only reason you two are doing the tack, and there&#x2019;s a mess of it, is it&#x2019;s warmer in the tack room,&#x201d; Betty good-naturedly said.<br><br>Sam, the brother of Sister&#x2019;s gentleman friend, grinned. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why we&#x2019;re doing it.&#x201d;<br><br>The two men, friends from their days spent living under the downtown bridge by the train station, stripped off their coats, walked into the paneled tack room. Both men had endured detox and counseling, although at different times. Neither of them could get a good job once clean because too many people remembered their misdeeds when drunk. Both wound up working for Crawford Howard, a man with an outlaw pack of hounds. As he hailed from Indiana, he took a chance on them and both Sam and Rory were grateful. Crawford and Sister, often crossways with each other, declared a truce thanks to Sam&#x2019;s steady work and putting in a good word for Sister. Sam and Gray, his brother, had known the tall, slender woman most of their lives. She and her late husband would give them horses to ride as kids. Sam, younger, went to Harvard. Gray, a few years older, in his middle sixties now, had received a full scholarship to the Darden School of Business at the University of Virginia and from thence to a large accounting firm in D.C. where he rose to partner. Gray, one of the first African American men to reach such power in our nation&#x2019;s capitol, wore it lightly. The Lorillards were bright people, as was their aunt Daniella Laprade, often married, each husband richer than the last. God knows, in her nineties she might do it again.<br><br>Tootie ducked into the tack room for a moment. &#x201c;Sam, go light on the oil.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Will do.&#x201d; He smiled at the beautiful young woman, almost a carbon copy of her knockout mother.<br><br>Tootie returned to Iota, her horse.<br><br>&#x201c;Master, thank you again for loaning me Matador.&#x201d; Weevil, finishing the braiding, picked up the stool, placing it alongside the stall. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s got so much scope.&#x201d;<br><br>He used the term meaning &#x201c;the horse could jump both high and wide,&#x201d; much desired in the hunt field.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s good for him to be ridden,&#x201d; Sister replied. &#x201c;I only hunt him about once every two weeks. That will change next season because I really must retire Lafayette.&#x201d;<br><br>The gray Thoroughbred, in his stall, shouted, &#x201c;I am not retiring. I can still outrun any horse on this farm. Just forget the retirement crap.&#x201d;<br><br>Raleigh, a Doberman, and Rooster, a harrier, Sister&#x2019;s house dogs, both stretched out on benches, tormented the older horse. &#x201c;Retire. Eat apples and carrots all day. Hey, maybe you can take up golf.&#x201d; Raleigh bedeviled him.<br><br>&#x201c;Horses don&#x2019;t play golf, idiot,&#x201d; Lafayette answered quickly.<br><br>&#x201c;I know that,&#x201d; the sleek Doberman, wearing his blue jacket, fired back. &#x201c;You can escape and run all over the golf course. Think of the newspaper coverage.&#x201d;<br><br>Rooster joined in. &#x201c;Loose horse destroys greens, tears up Ninth Hole.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Claims he was chasing a fox,&#x201d; Raleigh added.<br><br>Lafayette snorted. &#x201c;Better that than dog poop.&#x201d;<br><br>Before this could further develop, Sister&#x2019;s cellphone rang. She stepped down, punched the icon, walked into the tack room.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re going in there to get warm,&#x201d; Betty called after her, &#x201c;leaving us out here to freeze.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ronnie? What&#x2019;s up?&#x201d; she asked the hunt club&#x2019;s treasurer on the line. Although a lawyer, Ronnie liked being treasurer, though he had Gray&#x2019;s help when needed.<br><br>&#x201c;Forgive me, last minute but I&#x2019;d like to bring a guest from Deep Run.&#x201d;<br><br>She dropped into a director&#x2019;s chair while Sam and Rory dismantled a bridle each to completely clean it and shine the bit. No shortcuts.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course, you know I love Deep Run.&#x201d; She did, too, as Deep Run was the grand and glamorous hunt outside Richmond. &#x201c;Anyone I know?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so. Gregory Luckham. I&#x2019;m lending him Pokerface.&#x201d; He named one of his horses.<br><br>Sister sat up a little straighter. &#x201c;The Gregory Luckham?&#x201d;<br><br>Now both Sam and Rory turned to look at her.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, we worked together in Richmond, both of us on the Side by Side fundraiser. I found out he hunted. Would you like to join us for dinner at Farmington Country Club?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you, Ronnie, no. You know how crazy it gets before one of the big hunts but of course, he is welcome. I look forward to meeting him. Before I forget, Betty and Tootie talked me into braiding with red and green yarn for Christmas. You know I&#x2019;m not much for that kind of thing but they told me I was an old fart. To my face. Well, Betty, not Tootie, so I relented.&#x201d;<br><br>Ronnie, one of Sister&#x2019;s late son&#x2019;s best friends, stifled a laugh. &#x201c;You are always correct and I try to live up to your standards, but a little bit of Christmas cheer isn&#x2019;t too much a violation of tradition. Good decision.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You really think so?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sister, you always make the right decision. Which reminds me. Have you looked at the Weather Channel?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The snowstorm?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re predicting it for tomorrow afternoon.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I saw that, too, so I figure we&#x2019;ll hunt for two hours, two and a half, then turn back. I spoke to Kasmir about it and we both decided to move the Christmas breakfast to Boxing Day. This way people can get home ahead of the storm. You know how weathermen dramatize any hint of trouble, so this should calm the nervous.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good plan. You were smart to send the email early.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ronnie, instant communication means everyone wants a decision pronto. How do I know what will happen tomorrow? The Weather Channel predicts a giant snowflake will fall upon Albemarle County. Everyone panics. I like to think things through and one thing I know I can&#x2019;t think through is the weather. Have you ever noticed how wrong those forecasts usually are?&#x201d;<br><br>He laughed. &#x201c;I have, but still you were smart. And as I said, you always make the right decision.&#x201d;<br><br>She hung up the phone feeling a bit elated.<br><br>Sam, rubbing down a rein, said, &#x201c;The president of Soliden, the big energy company? Gregory Luckham?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; She stood up, slipping the phone in her jeans back pocket. &#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br><br>Rory answered. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a brave man coming here, the outrage over the pipeline.&#x201d;<br><br>Sam filled in. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think anyone will do something stupid at the hunt but you never know. People are really passionate about this, cutting trees, violating a national park, harming the environment. And one of the projected paths dips right over the Blue Ridge, tears up Old Paradise, goes across Tattenhall Station straight through Beveridge Hundred. It&#x2019;s lethal.&#x201d; He named beautiful Hunt Club fixtures.<br><br>Rory provided the other side. &#x201c;Jobs. Lots of jobs. Everything is shareholder value. Soliden doesn&#x2019;t care what is ruined, what animals harmed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Obviously I&#x2019;m against the destruction, but I can&#x2019;t believe someone would make a fuss at Christmas Hunt.&#x201d; Sister wondered why so many people were so passive about such things.<br><br>&#x201c;Outsiders?&#x201d; Sam raised his eyebrows.<br><br>&#x201c;Sam, I truly doubt that Gregory Luckham is advertising that he is coming to Jefferson Hunt&#x2019;s Christmas Hunt.&#x201d; Sister paused. &#x201c;At least, I hope he&#x2019;s not advertising.&#x201d;<br><br>Back in the aisle she mentioned Ronnie&#x2019;s call and heard the same concerns she&#x2019;d just heard in the tack room.<br><br>&#x201c;Everything will be fine. Come on, it&#x2019;s Christmas.&#x201d; She smiled, climbing back up on the low stepladder. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t remember finishing the braids. They&#x2019;re so tight.&#x201d;<br><br>No one said a word.<br><br>Weevil had finished her braids while she was in the tack room. Took him no time at all.<br><br>She led Aztec back into his stall, arranged his good rug on him, walked out sliding the door behind her.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know which one of you finished my job but I do thank you. My fingers aren&#x2019;t what they once were.&#x201d;<br><br>Shaker smiled. &#x201c;Ah, but Boss, you can still outride any of us.&#x201d;<br><br>She laughed. &#x201c;Now that is a lie. I keep up. And, in truth, I love it. I&#x2019;m most alive on a horse. Aren&#x2019;t you all?&#x201d;<br><br>They agreed.<br><br>Weevil, who was learning to love her, lifted an eyebrow. &#x201c;Christmas. The birth of our dear Lord.&#x201d; They stopped to look at him. &#x201c;I believe if Jesus lived here he would be a foxhunter. Scenting is no good in Galilee. But Jesus was a sportsman. He was a fisherman.&#x201d;<br><br>They laughed, happy in one another&#x2019;s company. Weevil reminded Sister of her late son, RayRay, Raymond, who died in a farming accident at fourteen in 1974. Weevil possessed Ray&#x2019;s quick way with words, his sense of humor, his love of hounds and hunting. You go on. No matter what happens you go on. She knew despite all, she was a lucky woman. Her husband, Big Ray, was also gone. Ray&#x2019;s boyhood friends, in their fifties now, stayed close to her. And she didn&#x2019;t care if it sounded like wish fulfillment, she could feel her husband&#x2019;s love and her son&#x2019;s love. She never stopped loving them and would love them until the day she died. She could even feel horses, hounds, house dogs, and cats who loved her.<br><br>As she swept her eyes on the people in the barn, she thought to herself, Love is all that matters. It&#x2019;s so simple. Why do people make life so hard?<br><br>Betty interrupted this reverie. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re wearing garters tomorrow, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course. Why are you asking me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So I&#x2019;ll wear mine. They cut.&#x201d; Betty complained.<br><br>&#x201c;Then put moleskin under your breeches, twit.&#x201d; Sister teased her.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a good idea.&#x201d; Weevil found garters to rub, too.<br><br>Sister tapped her head. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d be surprised what&#x2019;s up there.&#x201d; Then she thought to herself, Amor Vincit Omnia. Bless Ovid. Love conquers all.<br><br>CHAPTER 2<br><br>Festooned, a huge, perfect Christmas tree commanded the anteroom before the formal dining room. Christmas balls from the 1920s, glittering new balls, angels, all testified to the longevity of Farmington Country Club, plus why throw holiday decorations away? This redbrick Georgian structure, a hint of Palladio, had been designed by Thomas Jefferson as a private residence before politics overtook his life. Like so many old houses, places, it survived tumultuous times, some up, many down, only to fall into the hands of a few who wished to save it. No one could imagine living there as a family, it was simply too enormous, having been built when one housed one&#x2019;s immediate family, often one&#x2019;s in-laws plus every shirttail cousin within a hundred-mile radius. Housing for slaves needed to stand the test of time and they did. Farmington was built to last. The way to save it was to turn it into a country club, which was done in 1927.<br><br>Naturally, many were shocked&#x2014;a commercial venture, how crude. Those many, however, didn&#x2019;t really have two nickels to rub together, much less what it would take to preserve this elegant place. And so Farmington Country Club inched Albemarle County a bit further toward the New South, which, of course, remained the Old South in ways both laudable and detestable.<br><br>The club flourished thanks in no small part to a fabulous golf course, expanded over the decades. The old course, built before land became outrageously expensive, could boast par fives, par fours, and this course did that. The shrubs, old trees, exquisite plantings made golfing as much a joy as possible, although clubs still landed in the ponds.<br><br>The formal dining room, painted in eighteenth-century subdued colors, remained a steadfast glory, and it was in this glory that a few Jefferson Hunt members gathered before tomorrow&#x2019;s Christmas Hunt.<br><br>Ronnie had called together people to meet Gregory Luckham. Dewey Milford, ever at nonprofit fundraisers, was acquainted with Luckham. Ronnie believed more was accomplished socially than was ever accomplished at corporate meetings or on the floor of Congress. So he had invited people who could make a difference.<br><br>Gregory, a full head of ginger hair, sat next to Marty Howard, middle-aged, attractive. Marty knew how to get things done. Next to Marty sat Cecil Van Dorn, in his middle eighties, next to him was his wife, Violet Van Dorn. Sometimes they needed to help each other. Crawford was next to Charlotte Abruza, a historian he had hired to firmly place Old Paradise on the historic register as well as fight the pipeline. Old Paradise, founded in 1812 by a beautiful woman raiding the British supply trade, had a great history of feminist values. Sitting next to Charlotte was Dewey Milford, forties, perhaps the county&#x2019;s most successful real estate developer, and then next to Ronnie glowed Yvonne Harris, the former runway model, one of the first African American models to make the cover of Vogue, who could destroy a man with one smoldering look.<br><br>One tried to seat girl-boy-girl-boy and Ronnie did his best. Given that he was gay, he thought he provided ballast. He wasn&#x2019;t aggressive about being gay; he just was who he was, which was delightful.<br><br>&#x201c;Crawford, I do wish you would hunt tomorrow. For all we know the fox will flee over to Old Paradise. You&#x2019;ll be right at home.&#x201d; Ronnie encouraged him.<br><br>Marty smiled. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be there to see you off. Neither Crawford nor I like the cold weather and it&#x2019;s going to be frigid tomorrow, plus the threat of a storm. I just feel that moisture in my bones.&#x201d;<br><br>Cecil laughed. &#x201c;Funny how that happens.&#x201d;</p><h2>Rolling Thunder against the Rising Sun: The Combat History of U.S. Army Tank Battalions in the Pacific in WWII</h2><p>Although the history of armor in World War II has captured the attention of countless authors, no one has yet chronicled the extensive use of tanks in the Pacific--until now.

For his lifelong work on behalf of children, Coles received the Medal of Freedom from President Clinton. He lives in Concord, Massachusetts. <b>Randy Testa</b> is on the professional development staff at the Ross School in East Hampton, New York. He is at work on a book about preschool teacher Vivian Gussin Paley. He lives on Shelter Island, New York.In their introduction to this anthology of short literary works showing facets of life in medical care, Coles and Testa reflect fears that our medical schools are still not adequately preparing students to "understand and connect [with patients in] heart, mind, and soul." The editors and their three collaborators assembled the anthology with the hope that it might offer readers in the health care professions a fresh perspective on their responses to those they care for each day. The 53 selections are grouped according to four attributes: altruism, knowledge, skill, and duty. These attributes have been specified by the Medical School Objectives Project of the Association of American Medical Colleges as those needed by medical graduates when they enter the world of medicine. Some of the selections are essays; some are poems; and some are very short stories. Some of the authors are widely known -- Anton Chekhov, Walt Whitman, and William Carlos Williams, for example. Some are known mainly within medicine -- Eric J. Cassell, Lewis Thomas, John Stone, and Abraham Verghese. Some are probably known only to their immediate colleagues. The short introduction to each selection defines its place in literature and tells us something about its author. The title of the book, A Life in Medicine, suggests that it is a biography or autobiography. It would have been more informatively cast as Lives in and around Medicine. The voices from those lives differ widely in their identities. Yes, some are the voices of persons directly involved in medicine: a medical student, a nurse, a physician, a resident. Others are the voices of persons whose lives touch medicine in some way: a patient, the family of a patient, a social observer. All these voices are relevant to medicine and how it is practiced. Most of the selections reflect specific episodes: clinical errors, cultural clashes, or interior reflections on clinical encounters. Several of the essays -- notably those by Cassell and Thomas -- are detached analyses of practice in contemporary medicine, but they do serve to support Coles's and Testa's central thesis. Will the works collected here do what the editors hope they will? Will they show health care workers how to see, or see more clearly, the distress, the suffering, and the anguish of patients and their families, even of Ingelfinger's "worried well"? Would other choices have been better? The English-language literature relevant to the editors' aims is enormous. Every reader of this anthology is likely to think of alternatives that might be more effective. For a terse and powerful description of pain I can think of no more relevant work than Emily Dickinson's 1862 poem that opens, "Pain -- has an Element of Blank --." And there is Fanny Burney's wrenching account of undergoing breast surgery without anesthesia in an 1811 letter to her sister. But Coles's and Testa's choices do serve their aim. Some physicians, even if they left medical school poorly educated in seeing patients as persons, come to see the importance of this skill. They will certainly be one of the audiences for this anthology. The other audience members may be readers not working in health care fields but becoming involved in any of them as patients or members of patients' families. For them, the book might simply echo their views of what goes on in doctors' offices and hospitals. Its more valuable effect might be to empower them to ask for, and expect to receive, what seems missing but sorely needed in clinical engagements. A piece such as Anne Fadiman's account of a collision between a Laotian Hmong family and California clinicians is a good example of what may become an increasingly frequent problem in multiethnic America. The "outs" may see in this anthology support for their desire to get better care from the "ins." Such expectations of those who do not feel understood in our health care system can be unnerving to some clinicians who have left medical training with an all-too-common sense of omniscience about all matters medical. This is an aspect of medical education that should change. Patients and their families now search the Internet for clearer answers to their medical questions and what might be done about their concerns. They read accurate medical reporting in the New York Times, Newsweek, and other popular publications. Then they raise questions: "Doctor, what do you think about such-and-such for my condition?" I do not know whether Coles and Testa hoped that this anthology would empower those who have thought of raising such questions, but I think it might. Will this anthology and the many persons in and out of medicine who agree with its central thesis be able to influence our medical schools to prepare their graduates more effectively to see patients as persons? I doubt it. Many schools, perhaps most, are now medical universities: assemblies of research institutes and financially profitable units engrossed in producing technically skillful subspecialists, and not schools focused mainly on training students in the skills central to the practice of medicine, whatever their final choice of specialty. Prestige, reputation, and power hinge on eminence in research and on how many dollars can be squeezed out of the National Institutes of Health or from industrial collaborations, not on the skills of their graduates in patient-physician relations. <i>Edward J.

Mario was more than ten years my senior, a World War II veteran, while I was a twenty-year-old college graduate who took Dr. Wolfe's freshman English course at NYU, inspiring me to devote my life to writing.<br><br> The class met once a week, but a few of us from the class were chosen by our classmate Harold Applebaum, who was a published poet that frequently appeared in <i>The New York Times</i>, to meet periodically in our homes to read our work and generally socialize. Mario and I were among some of the select few; we liked to think that Harold had chosen us because he deemed our work as reflecting superior talent. We were flattered of course, although in retrospect, many of the students in that class were extraordinarily talented. I think there were about six of us among Harold's chosen, all determined writers hoping to make our mark and who were all flattered by Harold's attention.<br><br> Years later when <i>The Godfather</i> was published, I was quick to purchase the book and gobbled it up with relish. I thought the book was wonderful. When it hit the silver screen its impact was extraordinary and spawned a giant career for my fellow classmate.<br><br> I can trace a direct line from <i>The Godfather</i> to my characters in <i>We Are Holding the President Hostage</i>. Another influence was the fact that I had grown up in Brownsville, Brooklyn, in the neighborhood that was the headquarters of Murder Inc. and had observed in person many of the gangsters who were part of that era.<br><br> Another influence of mine was the fact that I had become familiar with the White House and its inner workings, having been a consultant to the Nixon White House with a blue pass that gave me access. Although there was tight security in those days it was far more lenient than it is today.<br><br> It was also a time when hostage taking was just beginning to show its ugly face and the news was filled with incidents in which the taking of a hostage was becoming a political act of choice. For me, it was a question of connecting the dots. I was able to imagine a story where a group of mafia characters, one of whose daughters was taken hostage in Egypt, were able to infiltrate the White House with the express purpose of persuading the president to use mafia tactics to deal with the hostage taking.<br><br> <i>The Godfather</i> will always have a special place in my heart, being one of the major influences that sparked <i>We Are Holding the President Hostage</i>, including my political experience and the events going on around me during the 1980s. But it really comes down to my relationship with Harold and Mario. If I had never known them, then perhaps the course of events wouldn't have played out the way they did and the idea for my book never would have materialized.<b>Warren Adler&nbsp;</b>is best known for&nbsp;<i>The War of the Roses</i><i>,&nbsp;</i>his masterpiece fictionalization of a macabre divorce turned into the Golden Globe and BAFTA nominated dark comedy hit starring Michael Douglas, Kathleen Turner and Danny DeVito.&nbsp;In addition to the success of the stage adaptation of his iconic novel on the perils of divorce, Adler has optioned and sold film rights to more than a dozen of his novels and short stories to Hollywood and major television networks.&nbsp;<i>Random Hearts</i><i>&nbsp;</i>(starring Harrison Ford and Kristen Scott Thomas),&nbsp;The Sunset Gang<i>&nbsp;(starring Jerry Stiller, Uta Hagen, Harold Gould and Doris Roberts)</i>,<i>&nbsp;Private Lies,&nbsp;Funny Boys,&nbsp;Madeline's Miracles,&nbsp;Trans-Siberian Express&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;his&nbsp;Fiona Fitzgerald&nbsp;mystery series&nbsp;are only a few titles that have forever left Adler's mark on contemporary American authorship from page to stage to screen.&nbsp;Learn more at warrenadler.com.</p><h2>The Eleventh Hour: A Curious Mystery</h2><p>When Horace the Elephant decides to throw himself a party for his 11th birthday, he never suspects a crime will be committed by lunchtime.

Volume 2, 1923-1925</h2><p>Volume Two covers the early years of his editorship of "The Criterion" (the periodical that Eliot launched with Lady Rothermere's backing in 1922), publication of "The Hollow Men" and the course of Eliot's thinking about poetry and poetics after "The Waste Land". The correspondence charts Eliot's intellectual journey towards conversion to the Anglican faith in 1927, as well as his transformation from banker to publisher, ending with his appointment as a director of the new publishing house of Faber &amp; Gwyer, in late 1925, and the appearance of "Poems 1909-1925", Eliot's first publication with the house with which he would be associated for the rest of his life. It was partly because of Eliot's profoundly influential work as cultural commentator and editor that the correspondence is so prolific and so various, and Volume Two of the "Letters" fully demonstrates the emerging continuities between poet, essayist, editor and letter-writer.</p><p>Thomas Stearns Eliot was born in St Louis, Missouri, in 1888.

Since then she has won a number of blue ribbons and awards for her lace. She is an accredited teacher with the Australian Lace Guild and a member of Tatters&#39; Guild of New South Wales.Over the last 200 years, tatting, a type of knotted lace made by manipulating a small shuttle to create delicate rings and chains, has evolved to such an extent that it is sometimes difficult to understand instructions in older tatting pattern books without the aid of a dictionary. To my knowledge, this is the first illustrated dictionary of tatting ever published. Australian teacher Connors (Beads in Tatting; The Illustrated Dictionary of Tatting) includes both modern and historical terminology, as well as brief biographical information on well-known figures in the craft. This work should be on the shelf of any library that collects tatting books. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Neil Gaiman and Philosophy: Gods Gone Wild!

Now, Amanda Elyot breathes new life into this remarkable woman, in what might have been Emma's very own words. <br><br> The impoverished daughter of an illiterate country farmer, young Emily Lyon sold coal by the roadside to help put food on the family's table. By the time she was fifteen, she had made her way from London nursemaid to vivacious courtesan, and continued a meteoric rise through society, rung by slippery rung, to become the most talked-about woman in all of Europe, mistress of many tongues, a key envoy in Britain's and Italy's war against the French, and confidante to a queen. <br><br> This novel, inspired by her remarkable life, recounts Emma's many extraordinary adventures, the earth-shattering passion she eventually found with Lord Nelson, and how they braved the censure of king and country, risking all in the name of true love.</p><p>Amanda Elyot is a popular author of historical fiction. She is a Cornell graduate and a professional actress.In order to eventually take her place in history as mistress of turn-of-the-19th-century English war hero Horatio "Hornblower" Nelson, Emma Hamilton must first socially ascend "rung by slippery rung" in Leslie Carroll's bright, meticulously researched novel (her third historical written as Elyot). A roadside coal peddler as a child in North Wales, Emma arrives in London at age 12 and works as a nursery maid, brothel entertainer, medicine-show chorus girl and mistress to several titled gentlemen before marrying Sir William Hamilton, "envoy extraordinary and ambassador plenipotentiary to the Court of the Two Sicilies." As Lady Hamilton, Emma becomes a close confidante of Queen Maria Carolina of Sicily and is pivotal in cementing England and Sicily's alliance as the Napoleonic wars get underway. Friendships with Haydn, Goethe and Marie Antoinette don't prepare Emma for Nelson, with whom she ultimately embarks on a scandalous five-year affair. Elyot gives Emma a rippingly bawdy, occasionally self-aggrandizing first-person, that, while sometimes grating, rings true. The result is an energetic portrait of a unique historical figure. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As the poet laureate of the Russian Revolution, Mayakovsky led a generation that staked everything on the notion that an artist could fuse a public and a private self. But by the time of Stalin's terror, the contradictions of the revolution caught up with him, and he ended in despair.</p><p>A major influence on American poets of the twentieth century, Mayakovsky's work remains fascinating and urgent. Very few English translations have come close to capturing his lyric intensity, and a comprehensive volume of his writings has not been published in the past thirty years. In <i>Night Wraps the Sky</i>, the acclaimed filmmaker Michael Almereyda (<i>Hamlet</i>, <i>William Eggleston in the Real World</i>) presents Mayakovsky's key poems&#x2015;translated by a new generation of Russian-American poets&#x2015;alongside memoirs, artistic appreciations, and eyewitness accounts, written and pictorial, to create a full-length portrait of the man and the mythic era he came to embody.</p></p><p><p><b>Michael Almereyda</b>'s films include <i>Nadja</i>, <i>Hamlet</i>, <i>William Eggleston in the Real World</i>, and <i>New Orleans Mon Amour</i>. His writing has appeared in <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>Artforum</i>, <i>The Believer</i>, and <i>Film Comment</i>.</p>The volatile young poet rose to prominence as a coauthor of the Russian Futurist manifesto A Slap in the Face of Public Taste in 1912; the next five years saw the explosive sexual boasting and the fragmentary lines of such poems as A Cloud in Pants, experimental plays and even participation in important Russian modernist filmmaking. An enemy of tradition in all its forms, the moody, energetic Vladimir Mayakovsky supported the Soviet revolution wholeheartedly, writing a poem called 150,000,000 in support of the Soviet army. Yet the passionate poet became worn down by the grind of his personal life and by Stalin's assault on something dear to him&#x2014;modern art. Mayakovsky shot himself in 1930, and his subsequent canonization by the U.S.S.R. made him a figure of ambivalence even for Russians who liked his daring verse. Mixing well-translated poems with bits from Mayakovsky's short autobiography <i>I, Myself</i>, excerpts from memoirs (by the likes of Osip Mandelstam and Francine du Plessix Gray) and short bits from critics' writings, Almereyda attempts to give Mayakovsky a new audience. Alas, the bits may be too short to sustain readers' interest, and the anthology&#x2014;like the poet's life&#x2014;seems choppy, confusing and finished all too fast. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The Romantic movement in literature, art and music transformed the West&#39;s outlook and system of values. The connection between the two is, the author argues, crucial to an understanding of the modern world, for, in his opinion, it reveals how those revolutions were made, and why most of them ended in failure. He also argues that the connection explains where most of the accepted pieties of modern social and political life come from, and that it has left us with all that is most terrifying in modern life, from genocide to political correctness. Concentrating not on dogma, but rather on the people who led the historical and cultural phenomena that were the &#34;Age of Revolutions&#34; and the Romantic movement, this book examines how the hearts and minds of key figures and of the masses alike were conditioned by cultural factors.</p><p>In <i>Holy Madness</i>, Adam Zamoyski has written a history of revolutions, and of the romantic and sometimes ridiculous revolutionaries who inspired them. But because revolution was so ubiquitous an activity in the 19th century, what he has actually produced is a comprehensive account of Western civilization from 1776 to 1871. Inspired by the American Revolution (1776) and the French Revolution (1789), the whole of Europe, and large portions of the rest of the world, was regularly convulsed by the urge to fashion Utopia on Earth. Zamoyski manages to flesh out these events with well-chosen detail and a fine sense of the touching comic-heroics they often entailed, as well as the bloodletting and the horror. As a historian of Poland, Zamoyski untangles the many uprisings in Eastern Europe with particular aplomb, but his account of France is also adept, with a vivid portrayal of the idealism of the Paris Commune, overthrown in 1871.<p> <i>Holy Madness</i> advances a particular argument: that the century of revolutionary upheaval was the direct result of the waning of religion as a universal human-value system. Post-Enlightenment men and women turned to the ecstasies of patriotism and revolution to fill the void left by belief in God, hoping to construct a paradise on Earth rather than wait for one in heaven. According to this thesis, revolution was a new theology: "The theology may have been shaky, but the new religion did have a god. That god was the sovereign nation, whose service was the highest calling, as countless revolutionary catechisms pointed out." It's an ingenious line, worked through thoroughly, although it doesn't explain everything--for instance, why Britain was almost entirely free of revolutionary upset during the same period. But this is thought-provoking and well-made historical writing. <i>--Adam Roberts, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>Adam Zamoyski was born in New York of Polish parents but has lived most of his life in England. He was educated at Downside and Queen&#39;s College, Oxford.</p><h2>Genesis: Ideas of Origin in African Sculpture</h2><p>Pondering the origins of the world and their own ancestry, African societies often sought to provide answers to these and other perplexing concepts in their oral traditions, poetry, and art. The Bamana people of Mali, for example, attributed the invention of agriculture and their understanding of the earth, animals, and plants to a mythical hero called Chi Wara, shown in sculptural form as a roan antelope. The elegant Chi Wara headdresses were created in wood in male-female pairs and worn during agricultural ceremonies. <p>This stimulating volume examines the Chi Wara headdress as an icon of African sculpture and presents forty examples of this well-known form. Major artistic traditions in other African societies-including the Dogon of Mali; the Yoruba of Nigeria; the Bwa, Bobo, Kurumba, and Mossi of Burkina Faso; the Kuba and Luba of the Democratic Republic of the Congo; and the Chokwe of Angola and Zambia-are also discussed in terms of the distinctive cultural perspectives and local traditions that inspired them.

Among recordings by bands such as Sonic Youth, Black Flag, Husker Du, The Minutemen, and R.E.M. was an album called "Sorry Ma . . . Forgot to Take Out the Trash", recorded by a scruffy, flannel-clad quartet from Minneapolis called The Replacements. Now, for the first time, all of the hearsay, half-truths, legends, and allegations associated with this maelstrom of a rock &amp; roll band are unraveled in this oral history by longtime Twin Cities music journalist Jim Walsh. </p><p>Through interviews with family, friends, and fans; former manager Peter Jesperson; Twin/Tone record label cofounder Paul Stark; and musicians around the nation influenced by the band, Walsh lays bare with painful clarity a tale that unfolds like a tragic comedy in three perfect acts. Celebrated by national publications, "the Mats" often seemed more hell-bent on sabotaging their status as critical darlings than parlaying it. With their markedly apolitical stance amid their decidedly political peers, their uncool embrace of "classic rock" influences like KISS and The Faces, and their Dionysian appetites (and the resulting tendency to literally fall on their own faces), The Replacements lasted 12 years despite themselves. </p><p>From the bands founding to their rise through the local and national club circuits, their major label deal in 1985, and the slow and painful implosion that followed, <em>The Replacements: All Over But the Shouting</em> lays down the gripping oral history behind the little band that could--but didn't.</p></p><p><p>This is the story of The Replacements, a band in three acts: from its founding through its ascension from the club scene to the national indie circuit and a major label deal in 1985, to its slow and painful implosion.&nbsp;<br><br> Twin Cities music journalist Jim Walsh tells the story of the band that began in a basement and was eventually celebrated by The Village Voice and Rolling Stone.&nbsp;Walsh follows The Replacements&#x2019; remarkable rise (seven LPs, a spot on Saturday Night Live, a Grammy nomination) and their equally thunderous downfall.</p><p><b>Here, finally, is the rollicking story of the notorious and celebrated band, as told by veteran music journalist Jim Walsh, an eyewitness who was always at the periphery of the storm, and often at its eye. </b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;The Replacements were superheroes: They rescued a whole planet from &#x2019;80s music.

Listening to the Replacements makes me feel the same things, and in that I'm like a lot of folks in my generation. Walsh was a participant observer in the counterculture that birthed this great band, and this insider account is as honest and insightful as oral history gets.

Immeasurably more transporting than an ordinary memoir, Walsh's book is a poetic toast to a band so effusively careless that everyone who saw them instantly cared. If you've ever fallen in love with &#x2018;that song,&#x2019; followed your favorite band from the VFW hall to the arena tour, or felt a Frankenstein-like primal spark at the sound of an opening riff, you'll get it.

A generation of smart, highly educated young people are spending their time knitting, canning jam, baking cupcakes, gardening, and more (and blogging about it, of course), embracing the labor-intensive domestic tasks their mothers and grandmothers eagerly shrugged off. Some are even turning away from traditional careers and corporate culture for slower, more home-centric lifestyles that involve &#x201c;urban homesteading,&#x201d; homeschooling their kids, or starting Etsy businesses.

Veterans of 1970s-era consciousness-raising groups would, I think, be proud&#x2014;these women don&#x2019;t need to be introduced to their cervixes with a hand mirror; they&#x2019;ve already become intimately familiar with their own anatomy via &#x201c;fertility awareness&#x201d; (like checking your own cervical mucus with your thumb and forefinger for signs of ovulation) and drug-free childbirth.<br> <br>At the same time, there&#x2019;s something deeply old-fashioned about the way the three women have thrown themselves so deeply into the role of mother. As partisans of what they call &#x201c;natural parenting,&#x201d; the three breast-feed on demand, share beds with their children, carry them in slings rather than in strollers, and generally devote much of their time to providing their kids with the purest, most natural food and environments. The Bellies to Babies studio, where Anne is an instructor, is a gathering place for these kinds of parents, offering classes in breast-feeding, prenatal yoga, placenta encapsulation (i.e., turning your placenta into vitamin pills), baby massage, and holistic nutrition.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is how people have always parented,&#x201d; says Claire, handing Rosemary an apple slice from a glass jar she&#x2019;s brought with her.<br> <br>Rosemary flashes a gummy pink grin and waves the apple slice above her head as if she agrees.<br> THE RISE OF DIY PARENTING<p></p> <br>The DIY ethos of New Domesticity truly flourishes when it comes to parenthood. Over the past decade and a half, hyperintensive parenting has become de rigueur for educated Americans. Some adhere to specific parenting philosophies like &#x201c;attachment parenting,&#x201d; which emphasizes continuous physical closeness and immediate parental responsiveness to babies&#x2019; cues. Others fastidiously monitor their children&#x2019;s environments, using cloth diapers, feeding children exclusively organic foods, giving them wood toys rather than plastic. Collectively, you might describe these intensive modes of parenting as &#x201c;DIY parenting.&#x201d;<br> <br>DIY parenting is about wearing your baby in a sling rather than pushing him in a stroller. It&#x2019;s making your own baby food rather than buying it at the store. It&#x2019;s homeschooling your child rather than sending her to public school. It&#x2019;s giving birth at home rather than relying on a hospital. It&#x2019;s about the idea that parents&#x2014;usually mothers&#x2014;know best and ought not to &#x201c;outsource&#x201d; care to day cares or food companies or schools if they can avoid it.<br> <br>This type of &#x201c;intensive parenting&#x201d; has become &#x201c;an imperative&#x201d; for middle- and upper-middle-class families, says Janet Golden, a historian who has written several books about the history of parenting and baby care. &#x201c;It presumes you have the time and resources to devote to your own small family and that doing so is a way of developing their futures,&#x201d; she tells me.<br> <br>As DIY parenting continues to rise in popularity, it&#x2019;s generated a scorching-hot debate. Is DIY parenting a sexist throwback, a way to push women into full-time domesticity by telling them it&#x2019;s what&#x2019;s natural and best for their children? Or is this truly a revolutionary way to parent, one that will benefit babies, mothers, and society at large?<br> &#x201c;IT FELT SO MUCH MORE NATURAL&#x201d;: THE APPEAL OF DIY PARENTING<p></p> <br>Before she got involved in natural parenting, Anne was so anxious and unbalanced she regularly took antianxiety medication&#x2014;&#x201c;You name it, I was on it,&#x201d; she says. Working as a teacher, the native Chicagoan became friendly with a fellow instructor who was also a birth doula, who got Anne interested in natural childbirth and healthy living. Anne gave birth to Derek without painkillers, using the Hypnobabies self-hypnosis program, followed by a daughter two years later.<br> <br>When Derek arrived, breast-feeding was a nonnegotiable must&#x2014;like any DIY parent worth her salt, Anne is a firm believer that breast-feeding is critical for healthy babyhood. But it didn&#x2019;t come easily.<br> <br>&#x201c;With breast-feeding, I struggled, as ironic as it is,&#x201d; she says, smoothing back her curly hair as she watches Derek careen around the room. &#x201c;I always had latch problems. But I didn&#x2019;t care what I had to do&#x2014;I was not going to feed him formula. It would have broken my heart if I couldn&#x2019;t breast-feed.&#x201d;<br> <br>Anne and her husband still share a &#x201c;family bed&#x201d; with their two children.<br> <br>&#x201c;It felt so much more natural,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;I had a crib, but I never used it. I felt so awkward, my child not being with me.&#x201d;<br> <br>When her son was older, she didn&#x2019;t feed him any jarred baby food, preferring the &#x201c;baby-led weaning&#x201d; method, which involves letting children go directly from breast-feeding to eating solid food on their own. Proponents say it helps with hand-eye coordination and ensures babies won&#x2019;t be overfed.<br> <br>With her daughter, Anne was &#x201c;so much more lax,&#x201d; feeding her boxed rice cereal.<br> <br>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t do that again,&#x201d; she says ruefully. &#x201c;She has so many more allergies.&#x201d;<br> <br>Claire, who has been interested in natural parenting since college, gave birth to Rosemary at home, in a room specially decorated for the birth, after reading books about home birth and researching the topic online. With home birth, &#x201c;I felt so much safer and more comfortable,&#x201d; she says, while hospital birth held &#x201c;so much scarier consequences.&#x201d; She worried about being forced into medical interventions, like an epidural or a caesarian section, worried about doctors and nurses not sharing her values around breast-feeding and postbirth bonding.<br> <br>Rosemary&#x2019;s home birth went perfectly, Claire says, and she plans on delivering her second child the same way&#x2014;her loose shirt hides the bump of her current four-month pregnancy. Her parents, however, thought she was crazy. Claire&#x2019;s mother, in particular, doesn&#x2019;t understand her daughter&#x2019;s all-consuming brand of motherhood and frequently asks her, &#x201c;If you stay at home, what&#x2019;s your identity going to be?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My mom wanted her [Rosemary] to cry it out!&#x201d; says Claire indignantly, referring to the method, popularized by pediatric sleep expert Dr. Richard Ferber, of training babies to self-soothe by allowing them to cry themselves to sleep for longer and longer time periods. For many DIY parents, crying it out is the moral equivalent of putting bourbon in a baby bottle.<br> <br>&#x201c;Gosh, that sounds like my mom!&#x201d; says Anne with a sigh. &#x201c;Mine are freaking out because she&#x2019;s not vaccinated,&#x201d; she adds, gesturing toward her daughter.<br> <br>All three women nod.<br> <br>The women, Gina explains, believe in vaccinating their children only on a selective or delayed basis. This often causes friction with their more traditionally minded families.<br> <br>&#x201c;My mother-in-law is head of infection control for one of the area&#x2019;s largest hospitals,&#x201d; she says, her sweater inching up to reveal a star tattoo on her wrist. &#x201c;We just lie and tell her we&#x2019;re fully vaccinated.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s only been vaccinated once, because I felt pressured,&#x201d; says Anne, of her son. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m waiting until he&#x2019;s five. My feeling is that they can get their immunities from daily living. I don&#x2019;t trust what they&#x2019;re putting in those things.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know anybody who actually does every vaccine,&#x201d; says Gina.<br> <br>&#x201c;The CDC schedule?&#x201d; Claire snorts, referring to the Centers for Disease Control&#x2019;s vaccine schedule, considered the standard by mainstream medicine. &#x201c;Nobody. Among people like us, I&#x2019;d be scared to say that she had had a vaccine.&#x201d;<br> <br>Gina, a former sommelier whose short dark hair and tinkling laugh give her a pixielike demeanor, became interested in natural parenting when she became pregnant with her son. Scared by stories of awful hospital births&#x2014;forced C-sections, women made to lie on their backs when they wanted to squat, unnecessary episiotomies&#x2014;she began to research alternative methods.<br> <br>&#x201c;I wanted to own my own birth,&#x201d; she says as she scoops her son up and begins to breast-feed. &#x201c;I guess that was my definition of feminism. Whatever I had to do to empower myself was what I was going to do.&#x201d;<br> <br>That initial research into alternative birthing methods &#x201c;completely changed the course of my life,&#x201d; Gina says. She became connected to a strong and vibrant community of like-minded women, women who were interested not only in alternative birth, but in all kinds of alternative parenting practices. She ended up giving birth with the help of a doula and a self-hypnosis program, laboring for thirty-eight hours without painkillers. Afterward, she was so impressed with the doula&#x2019;s work she decided to train to become one herself. She&#x2019;s now attended several dozen births in the Chicago area, and the natural parenting community has &#x201c;completely taken over [her] life.&#x201d;<br> <br>When the recession fell, Gina decided that perhaps this was a sign she should stay home. Though living on her husband&#x2019;s sixth-grade-teacher salary hasn&#x2019;t been easy, she feels she wouldn&#x2019;t be able to have as close a relationship with her son as she does if she were still working&#x2014;at two, he still breast-feeds, and she tries hard to follow his feeding and sleeping cues. If she was working full-time she wouldn&#x2019;t be able to cook from scratch or use cloth diapers as easily, all important parts of natural parenting.<br> <br>While she never envisioned herself as a stay-at-home mom, she loves it, she says. Embracing the role, she now blogs about motherhood, homemaking, and being a doula under the name Hipster Homemaker. She feels that by practicing eco-friendly natural parenting, she&#x2019;s part of a revolution.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is the new wave of feminism,&#x201d; she says, stroking her son Cooper&#x2019;s silky blond hair. &#x201c;Women who grow their own food and make their own diapers. Women taking back the home. This is my domain.&#x201d;<br> FROM BABY TRAINING TO BABYWEARING: THE RISE OF DIY PARENTING<p></p> <br>The 1950s mom would have laughed at the idea of homeschooling or home birth. Part of living in an authority-loving, paternalistic society was deferring to experts like doctors and teachers. Part of living in a society where homogeneity was valued meant going with the flow. You gave birth at the local hospital like everyone else. Your kids went to the local public or parochial school, unless you were especially wealthy. In any case, the economy of midcentury America was less competitive and less &#x201c;winner take all,&#x201d; so parents did not spend nearly as much time strategizing about how to get their children any possible advantage. In fact, parents usually spent less time worrying about their kids in general. Kids were expected to defer to all adults. Knowing your neighbor would discipline Johnny if she saw him playing in the road eased some of the burden off parents.<br> <br>All this led to an attitude toward parenting that was somewhat more&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. relaxed than what you see today. That stereotypical 1950s homemaker drinking a cocktail while the kids played kick-the-can till dark? She really existed.<br> <br>Today parents are expected to be the total authorities in their children&#x2019;s lives. Parents are taught to question everything they hear and make sure it &#x201c;feels right&#x201d; for their particular family. This can be empowering but also exhausting&#x2014;every vaccine and preschool and baby-food brand must be rigorously vetted by Mom or Dad (usually Mom). A neighbor wouldn&#x2019;t dare discipline your child. Even if you know your neighbors&#x2014;and many of us don&#x2019;t&#x2014;you are likely to have totally different ideologies about discipline and child rearing. Increasingly, the neighbor won&#x2019;t even give your child a snack, since she doesn&#x2019;t know what dietary philosophy you might adhere to. Is sugar okay? Is gluten? Is meat? Motherhood becomes, in the words of academics Susan J. Douglas and Meredith W. Michaels, &#x201c;an individual achievement, something you do alone, and you alone can screw up.&#x201d;1 Mom is not just Mom, she&#x2019;s also teacher, nutritionist, doctor, cook, and so on. No wonder 70 percent of Americans say motherhood is harder today than it was twenty or thirty years ago!2<br> <br>The story of parenting in the twentieth century is about a slow move from a cold, expert-focused, authoritarian style of child rearing to the warm, ultra-intense, DIY style we see today. How did we get from there to here?<br> <br>A hundred years ago, Americans were all about rigid, hands-off parenting. (&#x201c;If you must, kiss them once on the forehead when they say goodnight. Shake hands with them in the morning,&#x201d; advised early-twentieth-century psychologist John Watson in his 1928 book of parenting advice.) Through midcentury, &#x201c;scientific&#x201d; child-rearing advice was all the rage. Experts advocated rigid regimens for sleeping, eating, and potty training. These experts lamented the &#x201c;incompetence and inconsistency of mothers, and the social woes they caused,&#x201d; writes Ann Hulbert in her marvelous 2003 book Raising America: Experts, Parents, and a Century of Advice About Children.3 Midcentury mothers were cautioned against &#x201c;momism,&#x201d; the kind of overly close, overly protective parenting that would turn out sissies and weaklings&#x2014;a real cultural fear in the paranoid, macho Cold War era.<br> <br>Postwar parenting guru Dr. Benjamin Spock was the first to challenge this ideology. &#x201c;Trust yourself. You know more than you think you do,&#x201d; he told mothers. He encouraged women to use their instinct to feed babies when they seemed hungry and comfort them when upset, ideas which were so revolutionary at the time that Vice President Spiro Agnew even took a pause from his busy schedule to accuse Spock of corrupting the youth with his permissiveness. The tides of parenting were clearly turning.<br> <br>As part of the feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s, women continued to question the paternalism of doctors and child-rearing experts (even Spock). In 1971, the Boston Women&#x2019;s Health Book Collective published Our Bodies, Ourselves, a health care guide written to help women empower themselves to make their own medical and childbearing decisions. The book helped launch the so-called women&#x2019;s health movement, which sparked interest in natural parenting techniques like home birth and extended breast-feeding.<br> <br>At the same time, the idea of communal solutions for child care was receding further out of reach. In 1971, the Comprehensive Child Development Act, which would have established a federally funded, locally controlled system of day care, passed Congress with broad bipartisan support. But Nixon vetoed the act, denouncing it as a Soviet-style threat to the nuclear family.<br> <br>By the 1980s, parenting was b...</p><h2>Brother Cadfael&#39;s Penance: The Twentieth Chronicle of Brother Cadfael (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)</h2><p>In the autumn of 1145, Brother Cadfael finds himself in an awkward position. Receiving word that the son he had during the Crusades &#x2014; before he was a monk &#x2014; is in peril, Cadfael decides to attend a peace conference that might result in the young man&#x2019;s freedom. But to get there, Cadfael must leave the monastery without his abbot&#x2019;s permission. The Cadfael books are international bestsellers and have been produced for PBS&#x2019;s Mystery!</p><p>Ellis Peters is a pseudonym of Edith Pargeter, author of historical novels such as The Heaven Tree Trilogy. Under the name of Ellis Peters she wrote crime fiction including The Chronicles of Brother Cadfael and a more &#34;modern&#34; detective, Detective Chief Inspector George False. Ellis Peters won many distinguished writing awards including an Edgar Award, the Silver Dagger Award and the Cartier Diamond Dagger Award of the Crime Writers Association. She lived in Shropshire, England.Stephen Thorne is on familiar ground here with this twelfth installment of the Brother Cadfael series. And no one brings the details of medieval life so luminously alive as Ellis Peters. Brother Cadfael, Benedictine monk and herbalist, has had another life. Before entering the monastery, it appears he fathered a son he knew nothing about. When he receives news that this son is being held in the civil war raging between King Stephen and Empress Maud, his vows to God are put to the test. Many wonderful things have been said in the pages of AUDIOFILE, and elsewhere, about Stephen Thorne's exceptional voice and marvelous performances. I can only add that he narrates this series with perfection; it's subtle, fluid, and flawless. D.G.

Despite an overheated introduction that discusses, a bit shamelessly, Porter's and Coward's sexual habits (Coward liked "urbane young men," Porter preferred rougher trade), the book provides a remarkably open, mature, gay-positive reading of their lives that redeems what is otherwise just another recitation of two well-known careers. How wonderful to see Noel and Cole discussed as full, living, desiring human beings and not as immensely clever but essentially sexless creatures. Still, Morella and Mazzei skimp Porter, spilling so much ink about Coward that you might forget the book isn't exclusively about the Brit with the "talent to amuse," and they could have used better editing, for although much of the prose has the absorbing, breathless quality of good journalism, certain sections of the book are repetitious and overwritten. <i>Jack Helbig</i></p><h2>Naples Declared: A Walk Around the Bay</h2><p><b>A lively, elegantly concise historic tour of Italy&#x2019;s city by the bay</b><p></p><p>An invaluable addition to the art of literary travel writing, <i>Naples Declared</i> presents an informative and compulsively readable account of three thousand years of Naples history.

His dark face would not glow in the moonlight and give him away.<br> <br>He strained his eyes, searching the darkness beyond the treetops, hoping that the clouds would part enough to let him see the shapes of the dark cliffs across the river. That was Ohio, over there. In his parents&#x2019; day, back when this place was still part of Virginia, that side of the river would have meant freedom, but that had changed now. Now freedom&#x2014;or the lack of it&#x2014;was the same everywhere for ordinary people. And for madmen and criminals, there was no freedom at all. Since he had spent most of his life subscribing to, and even enforcing, that rule, it seemed churlish to object to it now, just because its strictures now applied to him. Those who are a danger to themselves or others must be restrained.<br> <br>He could never see the river itself&#x2014;it was nearly a mile away, beyond the fields on the other side of the road. Except in the dead of winter, the trees blocked the view, and then the steep embankment obscured the water. At least he knew it was there, though: the broad, dark waters of the Ohio rolling on to the Mississippi and on to its freedom in the Gulf. He would like to have seen that confluence, followed it even, all the way to journey&#x2019;s end. The puny little rivers where he came from, in the eastern part of West Virginia, weren&#x2019;t a patch on this one; why, except in the spring floods, you could wade across most of them. What was the point of being here&#x2014;so close&#x2014;and not getting to see the river? What was the point of being here anyhow? It wasn&#x2019;t as if they could help him. If he had been delusional, perhaps they could have led him back to reason, but he always thought that his problem was seeing the world too clearly.<br> <br>From somewhere down the hall a long scream pierced the stillness. One of the old men was either hallucinating horrors or remembering real parts of his past, perhaps as far back as slavery&#x2014;it was hard to tell which was worse, because those who imagined them believed with equal fervor. At least he was spared all of that. He spent a long time at night with his face pressed close to the window, and when he finally fell into bed, he did not dream.<br> <br>He wished he could either become entirely sane or else very much more mad. A delusion that transported you right away from unpleasant realities would be more blessing than affliction, it seemed to him. Let him drift away on a current of madness into a dreamworld where he was young again, where his gentle Eliza or her successor, clever Alice, was still alive and well&#x2014;or, better yet, some kingdom out of a fairy story, in which the world was entirely different from anything he&#x2019;d ever known. Let there be talking horses, and penny candy stick trees, and golden rivers of bourbon. He sighed. None of those fantasies particularly appealed to him any more than the real world did just now. He had spent his life in the profession of law&#x2014;not a discipline that encouraged its practitioners to be fanciful. He had always considered an excess of dignity and a dearth of imagination to be positive qualities in his character, but unless madness conferred its own artistic inspiration, his temperament made him ill-equipped to enjoy the benefits of delusion, and his lifelong habit of reserve would have held him back anyway. He was forever an observer, and one day he had decided that he had seen enough and wanted to leave. Yet here he was.<br> <br>His own particular form of insanity was to see the world exactly as it was, and to despair in silence.<br> <br>As he grew older, the truth, unvarnished by hope or illusion, made him desperate to escape life itself. But suicide was considered madness, rather than a shrewd appraisal of one&#x2019;s options, and so here he was in this barred asylum, as desolate and bereft of choices as Shakespeare&#x2019;s Ophelia, but prevented, both literally and metaphorically, from reaching the river.<br> <br>Odd that, while he could never see the river, there were other things that he did see sometimes in the night. A thing with glowing red eyes and leathery wings . . . Other patients had spoken of it, too, but while they had wild imaginations, unmoored from logic, he did not. Precisely because he saw things exactly as they were, he knew that whatever-it-was was real.<br> <br>Best not to speak of that, though. He couldn&#x2019;t be bothered to try to convince the long-suffering staff of the asylum that this one particular delusion was not one at all. It didn&#x2019;t matter really. The thing was doing no harm, except perhaps to make people who reported it seem madder than they actually were.<br> <br>It hadn&#x2019;t taken him long to figure out that these people could not help him, even if they wanted to, and that the best course would be to learn the rules of the game that would set him free as quickly as possible. He had been learning the rules and playing the game all his life, so this was just one more battle of wits, not much different from the others. There were no white people here, but the game was pretty much the same: those in charge versus those who had no power at all.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re up late tonight, James.&#x201d;<br> <br>He stiffened, nettled by the condescending tone, the use of his Christian name. He turned toward the doorway, where a shadow was silhouetted by the light in the corridor. &#x201c;With all due respect, sir, despite my present circumstances, I am not your inferior, and from the sound of your voice, I do not think myself junior to you in age, either. I am certainly not a child. Please address me as Mr. Gardner.&#x201d;<br> <br>There was a brief silence, while the shadow seemed to consider the matter. &#x201c;Need we be so formal? After all, you are a patient here. And I am an attending physician.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If we were on my home ground&#x2014;in a courtroom&#x2014;instead of in a hospital, would you willingly allow me to call you by your given name while you addressed me as &#x2018;Mister&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Perhaps not. We doctors like to stand on ceremony.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Have we met? Your voice is unfamiliar to me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;In passing. I have not treated you, but my room is just down the hall here, and I thought since we were neighbors I&#x2019;d pay a call on you. I couldn&#x2019;t sleep, either.&#x201d;<br> <br>The prisoner considered it. &#x201c;So you are our hall monitor. I remember you. You may come in if you like.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you. Another time, perhaps. I didn&#x2019;t bring the keys.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How odd that they house you doctors here among your patients. No one quarters lawyers next door to the criminals in the jail.&#x201d;<br> <br>The visitor chuckled. &#x201c;I suppose not, but there weren&#x2019;t many alternatives in this case. Point Pleasant is six miles down the road, and its population is mostly white, so it was deemed both inconvenient and awkward for us to try to live there. We&#x2019;re understaffed here, too, so it&#x2019;s helpful to have us in residence in case we&#x2019;re needed beyond our regular working hours. I don&#x2019;t mind. It saves me rent money.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Your voice makes me think you&#x2019;re mighty young, Doctor, and that last remark of yours clinched it. What&#x2019;s your name again?&#x201d;<br> <br>There was a slight pause before the reply. &#x201c;My name is Boozer. Dr. Boozer, that is.&#x201d;<br> <br>He laughed. &#x201c;Boozer? That name must have been a cross to bear at times.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I got used to it. By the time I was ten, I&#x2019;d heard every schoolyard jest that can be made about it, but after people become acquainted with me they stop noticing. And my parents tried to temper its effects by giving me an ordinary first name&#x2014;James. Like yours.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Boozer.&#x201d; Gardner considered it. &#x201c;No doubt people think the name means you are descended from drunkards. I don&#x2019;t suppose it does, though.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, not in our case. I can&#x2019;t speak for the original owners. I&#x2019;m sure our surname was a leftover from the white folks back where my parents came from, because its origin is Scottish, and we most definitely are not. I looked it up one time in the library when I was in Pennsylvania. It&#x2019;s a variation of Bousay, but God only knows what that means.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You must spend a lot of time explaining that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s best to get it out of the way quickly, I&#x2019;ve found. Anyhow, the staff says that you are an educated fellow yourself, Mr. Gardner, and your conversation certainly bears that out. When you called the courtroom your home ground, did you mean that you were a lawyer?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I am a lawyer, young man. I still am one. And when I get shed of this place, I shall resume my practice immediately back in Mercer County, so don&#x2019;t go thinking of me as a permanent fixture around here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I wish you well, Ja&#x2014; Mr. Gardner. And we&#x2019;ll do our best to send you on your way. God knows we need the space. They called lights-out a long while back, yet here you are, gazing out the window. Are you having trouble sleeping?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I savor the silence in the dead of night. If I had to exist only in the cacophony of daytime here, I would indeed go mad.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know. It helps to think of them as injured. They don&#x2019;t have any visible wounds to prove that, but I&#x2019;m certain they suffer just as much.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased?&#x201d; The mockery in Gardner&#x2019;s voice was unmistakable.<br> <br>&#x201c;We do what we can. Some people are easier to reach than others. I&#x2019;d like to help you, if you&#x2019;d ever like to talk about things.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Perhaps one day, young man. But you haven&#x2019;t lived long enough yet to have had much experience of the world. I warn you that the things I say, which to you will seem the sheerest lunacy, will be the plain unvarnished truth.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you standing at that window watching for the red-eyed demon some of the patients claim is out there?&#x201d;<br> <br>Gardner laughed. &#x201c;Perhaps I am, Doctor. And perhaps I cannot tell a hawk from a handsaw. But I&#x2019;ll tell you one thing I did not ever see&#x2014;the ghost of Zona Heaster Shue.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Who is that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A white lady&#x2014;just a country girl who died a long time back. I never met her, but she lost a case for me in court. She testified for the prosecution.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Before she died, you mean?&#x201d;<br> <br>Mr. Gardner laughed. &#x201c;No, after!&#x201d;</p><h2>Gray Foy: Drawings 1941-1975</h2><p><p><b>This elegant and distinguished book showcases the unique and mesmerizing art of mid-century American artist, Gray Foy</b>. Long eclipsed from public and private view, this large cache of drawings was discovered after Foy's death, mostly hidden in drawers and closets. The five-year effort to prepare the astonishing discovery for publication culminates in this stunning volume of drawings whose rare beauty will appeal to cognoscenti and general readers alike.</p><p>Born in 1922 in Dallas, Foy spent his youth in Los Angeles and went on to study art at Southern Methodist University in Texas and Columbia University in New York. His drawings appeared in numerous group exhibitions (including several Whitney Annuals), and he received a Guggenheim Fellowship. Foy&#x2019;s drawings are executed with a draftsmanship whose meticulously detailed qualities challenge the viewer&#x2019;s visual acuity. His early work, related to both Magic Realism and Surrealism, conveys affinities with artists as varied as Salvador Dal� and M.C. Escher, and is characterized by complexly interwoven compositions in which human figures, flora and fauna, and terrains and interiors morph into vivid dreamscapes. His mature drawings focus on botanical and geological forms in the process of transformation, metaphorically suggestive of the passage of time and the mutability of perception.</p><p><b>There has been renewed interest in Gray Foy's art as a result of a 2004 article in the <i>New York Times</i> by Steve Martin about the artist and his 1942 masterpiece, <i>Dimensions,</i> which Martin acquired and donated to the Museum of Modern Art.</b> Now for the first time, Gray Foy's work has been collected in <i>Gray Foy: Drawings 1941-1975</i>, which includes sixty-one full-color plates, an exhaustive chronology, and a selection of Foy&#x2019;s commercial illustrations for book jackets, magazines, and record album covers.</p></p><p><b>DON QUAINTANCE</b> is an independent graphic designer based in Houston and an occasional author and editor.

His work has been the subject of over fifty solo exhibitions in galleries and museums worldwide, including <i>Manifest Destiny</i> (Brooklyn Museum of Art) and <i>Alexis Rockman: A Fable for Tomorrow</i> (Smithsonian American Art Museum).

Martin was a friend of Gray Foy&#x2019;s since 1981.<br><br> <b>GRAY FOY</b> (1922-2012) was known as a great artist and avatar of New York City's literary gilded age. Born in in Dallas, he moved to Los Angeles with his mother at age four. In his youth he moved to New York where he studied art at Columbia, finding success with his unique art while still a student. He became an artist of substantial early reputation, embodying great artistic promise and drawing phantasmagorical scenes like no other artist. With Leo Lerman, his companion (and later, husband) for more than half a century, Gray Foy became a fixture of New York City's gracious, aesthetically-attuned literary and art scene of which Truman Capote was perhaps its most visible embodiment. They cultivated refined friendships with the city's foremost cultural luminaries such Frederick Ashton, George Balanchine, Leonard Bernstein, Paul Bowles, Maria Callas, Truman Capote, Carol Channing, Betty Comden and Adolph Green, Aaron Copland, Marcel Duchamp, Margot Fonteyn, John Gielgud, Martha Graham, Cary Grant, Ana�s Nin, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Edith Sitwell, Susan Sontag, and many others. But his engagement in this unique and rarefied social whirl largely eclipsed his art, which this volume brings to the fore once more showcasing an extraordinary assembly of Foy's drawings that had remained unseen for many decades until now."A typical pencil drawing by Mr. Foy, on which he might spend as much as a year, teems with massed forms that seem to rear up out of a shared shadowy past: human limbs and torsos, webs of twisted organic shapes that recall tree roots and leaves. The resulting image, built up of hundreds of thousands of tiny black marks, suggests <i>Guernica</i> done by M. C. Escher." (<i><b>Margalit Fox, <i>New York Times</i></b></i>)<br><br>&#x201c;A superb craftsman, a young person who will someday be reckoned with in the field of modern art.&#x201d; (<i><b><i>New York Herald Tribune</i>, 1948</b></i>)<br><br>"Gray Foy was...a serious artist whose supremely detailed and imaginative work recalls both M.C. Escher and Hieronymus Bosch. A new exhibition makes the case that Foy&#x2019;s drawings deserve a place in the canon of early Surrealist work." (<i><b>ArtNet News</b></i>)<br><br>"A pencil drawing by Gray Foy, a little-known American artist, is a scrambled, congested, Dali-like composition of body parts, still life, architecture, and landscape made with unbelievable refinement and microscopic detailing." (<i><b>Ken Johnson, <i>New York Times</i></b></i>)<br><br>"Gray Foy's drawing evokes the richness of living on a coral reef, or the cheerfully haunted rocks that provide a background to some of the finest Persian miniatures." (<i><b>James Trilling, <i>The Language of Ornament</i></b></i>)<br><br>"Were Gray Foy's extraordinary delicacy unaccompanied by poetic sensitivity to flowers and growing things, these drawings might be no more than astonishing tours de force. Such is not the case. They both amaze and please." (<i><b>Stuart Preston, <i>New York Times</i></b></i>)<br><br>The graphite-on-paper works by the late artist <b>GRAY FOY<b> are magical fantasies. They&#x2019;re a little bit Bosch, a little bit Dal�, and all his own glories. On view are the mid-century American artist&#x2019;s early Surrealist works, dated 1941 to 1975, many of which were recently discovered in his estate in drawers and closets.

The new school of gardening takes its inspiration from the sunny Mediterranean, from the cultivated spaces made to bloom in the desert, and from the richly ornate Arabic and Andalusian traditions. Two of the finest exemplars of such design are �ric Ossart and Arnaud Mauri�res, who have developed a contemporary vocabulary for arranging and restoring gardens--including some of the most prestigious in France and throughout the world. Through large-size captivating photos, sensuous, mood-enhancing poetry, along with advice and layouts, they bid you enter the worlds that so inspired them: spaces in Egypt, Spain, France, Tunisia, and Morocco lush with palms, colored with the reds of peppers and tomatoes, planted with banana, olive, and flowering cherry trees, redolent with the fragrance of oranges, perfumed by roses, and almost always, with water to cool and refresh the senses. Here, the gardens' grounds are "carpets" composed of many flowers, ochre walls mirror the fertile earth, and the details in each, from fine tiles to unusual containers, will leave you astounded.<br></p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: FrenchPoetic passages help define the elemental qualities of paradise gardens as the authors follow Islamic sources to the Mediterranean region and discuss vital design characteristics common to both ancient and modern gardens. Richly glazed tiles, sparkling water features, fragrant blossoms, and textural stone elements appear in profusion in the sumptuous photographs, many of which zoom in to illustrate all sorts of compelling details that garden planners might wish to consider. The gardens of Morocco and Tunisia, Spain and France yield a wealth of landscapes that will instruct, inspire, and invite reflection, with ideas for hardscaping and suggestions for plantings of both hardy and tender varieties. Delectable images of figs and pomegranates, lavish roses, and rainbows of mixed flowers accompany the enticing text, which incorporates a wealth of practical advice for do-it-yourself types. <i>Alice Joyce</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

They know their move from an apartment in Boston to a Victorian house on Nantucket will require adjustments, but both expect their willingness to work hardhe on his paintings; she on her needlework; both on their relationshipwill be immensely rewarding, even if John's career as an artist doesn't take off. But the apparition of a beautiful young woman severely disturbs their equanimity. Once the owner of their house, the woman appears only to John, and he quickly becomes obsessed with her. The ways in which Willy and John struggle to understand the ghostif indeed she is a spirit and not a figment of John's mindand cope with the devastation she wreaks on their relationship is the substance of this carefully wrought and quite credible ghost story.

Cahill's brief introduction provides useful background and a cogent description of the process by which selections were made. The suggestions for further reading at the end of the book provide a roadmap for further exploration. Each selection is prefaced by a brief biographical-historical introduction that locates the selection without presuming to tell readers how to interpret it. The richness of the selections derives as much from stylistic diversity as from cultural, linguistic, and religious diversity. In fact, many of the texts are not overtly religious at all--a tribute to the editor's broad definition of spirituality and one important factor in her ability to uncover material that is too often omitted from anthologies such as this one. More than half the book is devoted to material from the twentieth century, but the chronologically ordered material from ancient times through the nineteenth century will probably be the biggest surprise for readers unfamiliar with the territory. The effect of the whole collection, from the twentieth century and before, is a rich encounter (in Catherine de Vinck's image) with the woman--a community of women--dancing the world alive. <i>Steve Schroeder</i></p><h2>Quilting to Go</h2><p>If you can&#39;t find time to quilt, you will love the 40 plus projects in this 224-page book.

James Joyce's prose was denounced as obscene, and the book was banned in the United States and Great Britain. Controversy surrounded the work throughout Joyce's lifetime, and he claimed that the book would keep scholars busy for centuries.<br>Joyce was right. The book has become a veritable minefield for scholars, and has led to one of the world's most lucrative literary industries. In The Scandal of Ulysses, Bruce Arnold compellingly traces the life of Ulysses from its inception, through the great publication scandals of the 1920s and 1930s, and concludes with a lengthy examination of the copyright wars that have engulfed the book in recent years.<br>In this, the most complete history of Ulysses written to date, Arnold draws a vivid portrait of Dublin, London, and Paris in the period between the two great wars, through which we gain a more complete understanding of both early conflicts and more recent ones.<br>Chief among these is Ulysses: The Corrected Text, which was hailed as the ideal version of the book when it appeared in 1986, and its German editor, Hans Walter Gable, as a brilliant scholar who had restored Joyce to the reading public in as near perfect a version as was possible. Two years later, he was publicly denounced by John Kidd, a young American Joyce scholar, and one of the most ferocious literary controversies of recent times erupted.<br>Joyceans worldwide were deeply divided over the merits and defects of the new edition. Arguments against the Gabler version grew in volume. The earlier 1961 Ulysses was restored to the market place. New publishers came forward to edit and produce new versions. And the legal copyright, which ran out at the end of 1991, has caused more chaos, particularly in light of a new version of Ulysses edited by John Kidd, being published by W. W. Norton.<br>In a lively work of literary detection, with an American introduction written for the new edition. Bruce Arnold sets out the background, examines the legal loopholes, analyzes the arguments on both sides, looks at some of the hidden agendas, including controversial letters, and comes up with surprising and provocative conclusions.</p><p>The amazing printing history of James Joyce's Ulysses and its editorial disasters. Novelist Arnold (Running to Paradise, 1983, etc.) does a fine job of setting before us the horrors of getting a true version of Ulysses into print--which apparently hasn't happened yet. Though much of Arnold's material repeats itself, the repetition is all part of the disaster bred by Joyce himself and recently complicated by the three-volume Hans Walter Gabler critical edition (1984) and Gabler's one-volume Ulysses: The Corrected Text (1986), both of which caused a mudfest among Joyceans. While writing the novel in Paris (1914-21), Joyce sold individual chapters to American collectors. Those chapters also acted as the texts for first publication in The Little Review. The chapters, which bore Joyce's corrections, were never returned to him, while his own carbons had not been corrected. When The Egoist Press printed Ulysses, Joyce made entirely new corrections inconsistent with the already published chapters, which he could not get hold of, and meanwhile added nearly a third to the novel's bulk on his galley proofs. Joyce, who was going blind, was a poor editor and even embroidered imaginatively on his Paris printer's errors, thus establishing a first edition not only aswim with errors and gaga sentences but also wildly inconsistent with his own manuscripts. Moreover, when Joyce began Finnegan's Wake, he lost interest in correcting Ulysses. Joyce did help in the French translation of Ulysses, which sometimes helps to make sense of his English. When Gabler came along to establish a corrected text, however, he threw out the first edition, assembled only manuscripts, corrupt magazine versions, etc., and intuitively put together a still newer Ulysses that has incensed Joyceans. But the problems are infinitely more complicated than this. Essential. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>A Joyce scholar from Ireland, Arnold here jumps into the controversy surrounding the 1986 publication of Ulysses: The Corrected Text , edited by Hans Walter Gabler. Arnold circuitously traces the history of Joyce's masterpiece from its original publication in Paris in 1922 by Shakespeare and Co. through the labyrinth of successive versions edited by Joyce and others, partly in an attempt to get the ban (on grounds of indecency) lifted from the work. Today venerated by scholars, Ulysses , Arnold contends, has become a prisoner of Joyce academicians who wrangle over the "correct" version. Arnold argues that Gabler's 1986 edition, a computer-based merging of all previous editions, is a seriously flawed work whose publication was motivated by the Joyce estate's desire to maintain the financial benefits of copyright. Although this study will be of interest to scholars, general readers will be hard put to decode the nitpicking. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Temeraire</h2><p>hardcover in mylar protected dustjacket/new &amp; unused; no marks, not remaindered, not exlib, NOT bookclub, dj price (UK) intact and number 2 on copyright page/simple author signature, no inscription/fiction</p><p>Naomi Novik was born in New York in 1973, a first-generation American, and raised on Polish fairy tales, Baba Yaga, and Tolkien.

Twelve-year-old Amelia Forrester has just arrived with her family and they are eager to make a new life in Phoenix City. But the mostly male town is not that hospitable to females and Amelia decides she&#39;ll earn more money as a boy. Cutting her hair and donning a cap, she joins a gang of newsboys, selling Eastern newspapers for a fortune. And that&#39;s just the beginning of her adventures. Participating in the biggest news stories of the day, Amelia is not a girl to let life pass her by - even and especially when it involves danger!</p><p>Liza Ketchum is the author of many award-winning historical novels. She lives near Boston, Massachusetts.Starred Review. Grade 5&#x2013;8&#x2014;Never has 12-year-old Amelia Forrester found it so inconvenient to be a girl. Her mother and family friend, Estelle, can come all the way from Boston to San Francisco as businesswomen, but Amelia can't even sell a months'-old Boston newspaper without being assaulted and taunted by boys. While the two women&#x2014;dressmakers by trade&#x2014;adjust their business plan to make clothing for men, Amelia makes an entrepreneurial decision of her own. She chops off her long hair, dons a borrowed cap and trousers, and takes to the streets of 1851 San Francisco to hawk newspapers. Her nose for news soon leads her and her new friend, Patrick, to a much-hyped balloon launch. As fate would have it, they are invited to stand in the balloon's basket, but the men on the ground lose their grip on the tethers and the children find themselves soaring over the mountains. After a crash landing, Amelia is badly injured and brought to the mining town of Sonora to mend. Much to her dismay, orphaned Patrick finds a family with a French prospecting couple, while Amelia ponders her fatherless upbringing. She does finally recover, finds a newspaper editor who publishes her story, and returns home a hero. Ketchum nicely interweaves actual events into this engaging story. She also covers the topics of discrimination and same-sex couples with aplomb. Amelia is a well-rounded character: imperfect, persistent, unsure of herself, and likable.

Known in The Wildwoods as Doo Wop, the style is mostly represented in the resorts&#39; surviving motels, built between 1955 and 1970, and comes in a variety of forms: Modern, with jet-age glass walls; Vroom!, with thrusting pointed features; and Polynesian Pop, with thatched roofs and tiki torches.

He published more than 80 books as Lord Dunsany, including hundreds of short stories, as well as successful plays, novels and essays. Educated at Cheam, Eton College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, he served in the Boer War and both World Wars, moving in the 1930s from County Meath to Shoreham in Kent. Dunsany worked with W.B. Yeats, and was a significant influence on such writers as H. P. Lovecraft, J.R.R. Tolkien, Arthur C. Clarke and Isaac Asimov. In addition to his writing, Lord Dunsany was an influential campaigner for the scouting movement, the British Legion, and for animal rights. He set chess puzzles for The Times, was a pioneering writer of radio drama and appeared in early television programmes including the BBC&#39;s The Brains Trust. A Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and of the Royal Geographical Society, Dunsany received an honorary doctorate from Trinity College, Dublin, and was nominated for the Nobel Prize for literature. He died in 1957 of appendicitis, aged 79.`The book is a treasure-trove - no less than 26 tales of crime and detection, all illumined by Lord Dunsany&#39;s charm and wit, and his individualistic style.

A young, beached dolphin is raised in an aquarium and then, 10 years later, despite frailty and advanced age, gives birth to a baby that seems to have inherited her intelligence and stubborn personality. When young Bob leaps from the nursery tank to the performing pool and refuses to leave, the popular dolphin shows must be canceled. However, the staff is told that the mayor is going to be in the audience and that there must be a show for him. To insure Bob's safety, only his mother can perform. Everyone in the audience is disappointed, even angry, until bright little Bob begins to jump along with her. Then all are thrilled and, as luck would have it, Bob finally decides to return to the nursery tank. The audience's response to the dilemma seems questionable?surely visitors to a dolphin-rescue aquarium would be understanding if a baby dolphin's safety were at stake. George presents interesting information, including the behavior, raising, and training of dolphins in captivity, but her story simply doesn't hold water. Bob's opportune decision to perform for a disgruntled city official becomes a rather soggy ending to this tale.?Carla Kozak, San Francisco Public Library<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Kandinsky</h2><p>Vasily Kandinsky (1866-1944) was one of the founders of abstract painting, perhaps the most revolutionary development in 20th-century art. In this book, 40 of his major works are reproduced in full-page colorplates, each with an accompanying commentary.<p>Author Thomas M. Messer has selected important paintings from every period of Kandinsky's long and varied career. The early Riding Couple is followed by such masterpieces as the apocalyptic Composition VI and Composition VII, which date from the years before World War I that witnessed Kandinsky's radical breakthrough into a richly colored abstraction. Other colorplates include the complete set of four decorative panels executed in 1914 for the American collector Edwin R. Campbell and Several Circles, perhaps the finest geometric work from Kandinsky's years at the Bauhaus school in Germany. The artist's final decade, spent in Paris, is represented by such works as the valedictory Tempered Elan.</p><p>The introduction includes discussion of Kandinsky's highly original contributions to aesthetic theory, developed in the famous Blue Rider Almanac and his influential treatises On the Spiritual in Art and Point and Line to Plane.

Ancient China covers such key discoveries as gunpowder, anesthesia, and calendars, spanning a few thousand years. Early Islamic Cultures begins with the 600s and describes early surgical advances and medical treatises and the development of Arabic numerals, among other areas. Without going into too much depth, both books offer historical and cultural background that play parts in the scientific environment. The writing is crisp and lively, and some individual scientists are highlighted. However, on a few occasions the actual processes used by scientists are explained in detail, which detracts from the smooth historical narrative. Most readers will be able to appreciate the basic idea of how Chinese surveyors calculated the width of a river without a step-by-step explanation of the mathematical formulas. Closing chapters tie the discoveries of the past into the Western science revitalization that began with the Renaissance. For the most part, the books convey a true appreciation for the discoveries and for the cultures from which they sprang. Numerous full-color and black-and-white photographs, reproductions, and drawings illuminate the text. Though the titles, publisher, and author are the same, these are not strictly revisions of Watts's 1988 titles. They are shorter and written for younger readers. The earlier versions go into more detail and cover many developments not mentioned in the current editions, including China's agricultural innovations and the work of Islamic scholar Al-Biruni. The newer titles are less useful for in-depth reference but work better as basic introductions.<br><i>Steven Engelfried, West Linn Public Library, OR</i><br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Windfalls: A Novel</h2><p>Follows the experiences of two young and pregnant women: Cerise, who opts to raise her baby and faces painful challenges, including the ostracism of others, the death of her child, and homelessness, and Anna, who chooses to terminate her pregnancy and moves on to college and eventual motherhood. 35,000 first printing.</p><p>Jean Hegland was born in Washington State, but now lives near Healdsburg, California on 55 acres of second-growth forest with her husband and three children. As well as raising and home-schooling her children she teaches English and Creative Writing at Santa Rosa Junior College. Her highly-praised first novel, Into The Forest, was published in 1998.The decision whether or not to keep a child alters the lives of two young, single women in this moving if rather programmatic second novel by Hegland (Into the Forest). Telling parallel stories that ultimately converge, Hegland explores the value of work, art, family ties and the singular bond between women and their children. Anna, a graduate photography student, has an abortion, eventually marries and has two children; Cerise, a high school sophomore, keeps her baby, raises it on her own, ekes out a living and later has another child. In following the course of their very different lives, Hegland describes a full range of maternal emotions and experiences&#x2014;the mind-numbing exhaustion; the weight of responsibility; the fierce desire to protect; the boundless joys and heartbreaking sorrows. When a tragic fire results in the death of Cerise's second child and the loss of her home, Hegland illuminates the plight of homeless people and demonstrates how easy it is to lose one's sense of self. Cerise hides behind a new identity, as "Honey," and finds a job at a day-care center, where her resolve and sense of purpose in the face of heart-shattering grief are remarkable. Meanwhile, Anna's life is upended when her husband's sudden unemployment forces a move to California from her family's Washington homestead. Circumstances force her back into the workforce, and Hegland brings fresh insight to the struggle working mothers face in juggling home life with their careers. When Honey becomes a caretaker for Anna's two young children, a curious bond develops between Anna and Honey as the two women strive to find a sense of purpose in their lives. The result is a powerful, life-changing experience for both of them, bringing Hegland's novel to a poignant, thought-provoking conclusion. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But take a longer view&#x2014;look beyond and below politics&#x2014;and it is the unchallenged triumph of liberalism and its philosophical assumptions that ought to command our attention.<br><br>The triumph of liberalism means the tyranny of liberalism, explains James Kalb in this illuminating book, for liberalism is the extension into the sociopolitical realm of modern scientific thought and technological rationality. These modes of thinking are regarded by nearly everyone today as uniquely authoritative; those institutions and beliefs which do not conform are regarded at best as annoyances, and at worst as evil. Furthermore, Kalb shows how liberalism is an expression of the interests and outlook of commercial and managerial elites, who are suspicious of less rationalized and controllable forms of social organization like the family.<br><br>Kalb does not merely rehearse a tale of woe, nor is he content simply to analyze the current situation. With reference to concrete issues such as the debate surrounding same-sex marriage, he outlines the kind of traditionalist response to liberalism that is likely to be most effective. He argues that traditional, decentralized, and nonliberal forms of social organization are ultimately impossible to eradicate, and he shows how more human forms of association than those favored by liberalism might once again be brought into being.</p><p>James Kalb, who holds degrees from Dartmouth College and Yale University, is a lawyer and independent scholar whose reviews and essays on political thought have appeared in various journals in the United States and Europe, including Modern Age and Telos. Kalb blogs (http://turnabout.ath.cx:8000), lives, and works in Brooklyn, New York.*Starred Review* The title of this book&nbsp;may seem oxymoronic, which testifies to how completely the regime of freedom and equality that liberalism claims to be has triumphed over other sociopolitical ideas. But the equal freedom liberalism has brought is essentially the right to shop among goods, services, and &#x201c;lifestyles.&#x201d; The right to care about anything&#x2014;family, neighborhood, church, heritage, and the truths about human nature and existence they express&#x2014;except the economic-political regime, however, has shriveled under the onslaught of unelected management. Religion is judicially quarantined and separated from citizenship, state agencies assume familial functions, careerism undermines community, education becomes more vocational and less humane, and obligatory tolerance truncates public conversation. Meanwhile, epidemic psychological depression, uncontainable crime, endless warfare, and ever-increasing concentration of wealth indicate that liberalism&#x2019;s consumer paradise is far from perfect&#x2014;indeed, will and must collapse. Without any specialist jargon, reams of statistics, or heavy-handed anecdotes, Kalb makes us see how all the ills of liberalism logically proceed from its deliberate philosophical poverty. Preparatory to liberalism&#x2019;s demise, he suggests adopting a traditionalist outlook and resuming the loyalties and the functions liberal hegemony has tried so hard to suppress and usurp. Slow reading, perhaps, but vital and vitalizing. --Ray Olson</p><h2>Bark House Style</h2><p><p>Everything old is new again with Bark House Design: A Rustic Style Reclaimed.

They appear in a breathtaking range of projects: mountain, seaside, and prairie homes; resort lodges and inns; shopping centers; sports venues and other entertainment facilities; and built-in and freestanding cabinetry. </p> <p>The first use of bark shingles came in the mountains of western North Carolina from the American chestnut tree, sometime in the late 1800s. The style spread quickly through the resort towns and beyond: the classical lines had broad, timeless appeal yet synthesized three recognized decorative styles at the turn of the twentieth century-Rustic Revival, Shingle, and Craftsman but died out after 1940s. In the 1990s, the revival of bark architecture was generated by Marty McCurry, who made it his life's work to reinvent a modern-day process for manufacturing bark house shingles from poplar bark, utilizing green building practices. Building with bark requires a willingness to take responsibility and to make conscious choices about what you build and how you build it. </p> <p>Bark's appeal in construction comes from its feel of "instant age." A building clad in bark looks settled into the landscape as soon as construction is completed; it makes a home warmer and more comfortable to approach, and it makes larger buildings more intimate. No matter what variety of rustic styling you prefer-Adirondack, Cowboy, Craftsman, Modern Rustic-bark used in remodeling can act as a visually pleasing architectural tool to bridge the gap between old and new. </p> <p>As bark architecture returns today in new forms, it is easy to appreciate the inherent strength of the old bark house context and design. During this architectural revival, bark house design, with all its rich accents, has truly returned and has grown beyond the residential realm. Something of the original bark house lifestyle has returned as well: the appreciation of beauty, relaxation, and nature's glorious progression throughout the four seasons.

One of the oldest communities in America, it also is one of the most forward-looking and youthful. Take a stunning pictorial tour of this Colonial gem that helped give birth to the United States, led by a professor who knows every lively detail of its highways and byways, its landmarks and hidden treasures, its stories and lore. Through remarkably beautiful images, Jonathan Beagle ushers readers through the Back Bay, with its public gardens, renowned Old South Church, and John Hancock Tower, to Bunker Hill House and the USS Constitution in the North End, to the surrounding Hub with its many museums, memorials, and universities (including MIT and Harvard). Visit Faneuil Hall and Quincy Market in the Financial District; the Long Wharf Marina and the Aquarium by the Waterfront; and the State House and African Meeting Hall on elegant Beacon Hill. And of course, what trip to Boston would be complete without a stopover at Fenway Park, home of the Red Sox?<br><br>Beagle&#x2019;s engaging and knowledgeable commentary, along with the wealth of photographs, provide the perfect introduction to Boston for any native, visitor, or armchair traveler.</p><p>Jonathan M. Beagle, Ph. D., is Associate Professor of History at Western New England University in Springfield, Massachusetts. He teaches a course on Boston&#x2019;s history and was recipient of the University&#x2019;s 2012 Excellence in Teaching Award. Professor Beagle has also received fellowships and awards from many prominent institutions for his research, including the 2003 National Huguenot Society Biennial Award for his New England Quarterly article "Remembering Peter Faneuil: Yankees, Huguenots, and Ethnicity in Boston."</p><h2>Dear Juno</h2><p>Although Juno, a Korean American boy, cannot read the letter he receives from his grandmother in Seoul, he understands what it means from the photograph and dried flower that are enclosed and decides to send a similar letter back to her</p><p>A graduate of the School of Visual Arts in New York City, Susan Kathleen Hartung is the acclaimed illustrator of the award-winning <b>Dear Juno</b>, as well as beloved favorites<b>One Dark Night</b> and <strong>A Mom for Umande</strong>. <p> When not in her studio, Susan can be found renovating her 140-year-old farmhouse, or spending time with family and friends in her nearby hometown of Ann Arbor. Susan lives in Brooklyn, Michigan with her two dogs, Bongo and Audie, and her cat, Gomez.</p> <p> </p> <br>Picture-book debuts for both author and illustrator result in an affectionate glimpse of intergenerational bonds. Juno loves to get letters in the red-and-blue bordered airmail envelopes that come from his grandmother, who lives in Korea, near Seoul. He cannot read Korean, but he opens the letter anyway, and learns what he can from what his grandmother has sent: a photograph of herself and her new cat, and a dried flower from her garden. When his parents read him the letter, he realizes how much he learned from the other things his grandmother mailed to him. He creates some drawings of himself, his parents, house, and dog, and sends them along with a big leaf from his swinging tree. He gets back a package that includes drawing pencils and a small airplane -- the grandmother is coming to visit. The messages that can be conveyed without words, language differences between generations, and family ties across great distances are gently and affectingly handled in this first picture book. The illustrations, done in oil-paint glazes, are beautifully lit; the characters, particularly Grandmother, with her bowl of persimmons, her leafy garden, and her grey bun that looks "like a powdered doughnut," are charming.

The eighth in the Simon Serrailler crime series.</b> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>From the outside, the cathedral town of Lafferton seems idyllic, but in many ways it is just like any other place. It suffers from the same kinds of crime, is subject to the same pressures from a rapidly changing world, has the same hopes and fears as any number of towns up and down the land.<br><br>When one day DC Simon Serrailler is called in by Lafferton's new Chief Constable, Kieran Bright, he is met by two plainclothes officers.

After a week of frosts, the wind had swung to the west, bringing milder air. Snowdrops and crocuses were over, daffodils were flowering. Quiet, empty streets. No footsteps.</p><p>Jeff Barclay and Robbie Freeman sat on a low wall near the bus stop in the square, finishing off a shared kebab. They only had enough money for one, and a tea. Robbie screwed up the greasy paper and lifted his arm to throw it into a nearby bin. But his arm froze in mid-air.</p><p>&#x2018;What?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Bloody hell.&#x2019;</p><p><i>&#x2018;What?&#x2019;</i> Jeff shoved him so that he almost fell off the wall. Robbie did not protest or shove back, he just stared at the entrance to the Lanes, the cobbled pedestrian-only street to their left.</p><p>&#x2018;Shit, did you see that?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Didn&#x2019;t see anything. What was it &#x2013; a ghost?&#x2019; Jeff snorted.</p><p>&#x2018;No.&#x2019; Robbie said quietly, getting off the wall and walking towards the Lanes. &#x2018;I saw a kid.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;What sort of kid?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;A little kid. It ... it had no clothes on.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;You&#x2019;re taking the piss. I never saw any naked kid.&#x2019;</p><p>Jeff levelled with him as they reached the top of the Lanes. There were old-fashioned lamps at either end and a couple of shops had lighted front windows. The whole street was empty.</p><p>&#x2018;Stupid.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;No. I saw it. There was a little kid, it sort of &#x2013; just ran and then it vanished.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yeah, right. Come on, let&#x2019;s see if there&#x2019;s anyone outside the Magpie.&#x2019;</p><p>But Robbie was walking slowly away from him, looking closely to right and left. In the end, Jeff followed.</p><p>&#x2018;How could there be a kid?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;I know what I saw.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;What are you on, Rob? You start seeing things, you got a problem.&#x2019;</p><p>There was a passageway between the deli and a smart clothes shop, and as Robbie looked into it, he saw a quick movement &#x2013; something pale. He ran down, but he had to push past two wheelie bins, and by the time he had got through, if there had been anyone, they&#x2019;d gone.</p><p>&#x2018;Cat.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;No.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;You&#x2019;re mad.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;No.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Oh, for fuck&#x2019;s sake! I&#x2019;m off home.&#x2019;</p><p>It was another five minutes before Robbie followed him. They walked slowly along the kerb, thumbs out every time a vehicle went by. Not many did.</p><p>&#x2018;Wanker.&#x2019; Jeff gave two fingers to a speeding car. Robbie said nothing. His head was full of what he knew he had seen &#x2013; not imagined, not hallucinated, seen. A child, maybe three or four years old, naked, slithering out of sight into the shadows, dodging down the alley and passageway. He couldn&#x2019;t get it out of his mind.</p><p>A patrol car took the call at twenty to three.</p><p>PC Bev Willet sighed. &#x2018;Wind-up,&#x2019; she said.</p><p>&#x2018;Sounds like it. But just in case &#x2013; hold onto your hat.&#x2019;</p><p>It had been a quiet night. Even a wind-up was better than trying to keep awake with more plastic coffee. The car raced up the bypass.</p><p>&#x2018;How old did he say?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Little kid, three or so. Couldn&#x2019;t say if it was a boy or girl.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;And <i>naked</i>?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Naked.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;They piss me off, these hoaxers. I&#x2019;d have them dunked in the canal on a freezing night.&#x2019; Bev snorted as she pulled up at the entrance to the Lanes. One taxi was in the rank, the driver asleep with a copy of the <i>Sun</i> over his face. He didn&#x2019;t stir at the sound of the patrol car.</p><p>&#x2018;Talk to him in a mo. Come on.&#x2019;</p><p>Ten minutes later they had scoured the area, including every alley and passageway, every wheelie bin and recycling area.</p><p>&#x2018;Diddly squat,&#x2019; Bev said.</p><p>&#x2018;Pisses me off, this sort of thing.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;You said.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Only why would he invent <i>a naked child</i>, for heaven&#x2019;s sake?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Guaranteed to make us move fast.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Right. Just someone&#x2019;s idea of a good laugh then. Better go and wake up our cabby.&#x2019;</p><p>But their cabby had been out on jobs all evening and then fallen asleep. He was going home now. He&#x2019;d keep an eye out.</p><p>&#x2018;His face said it all.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Wind-up.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Wind-up.&#x2019;</p><p>Jess Honeywell&#x2019;s baby woke for a feed at four. She picked him up out of his crib and moved the curtain aside briefly to look out at the night. Starry, with a big moon. A front-bedroom light was on a few doors down. Another wakeful baby. She and Katie Green sometimes chanced to look out at the same time and then they&#x2019;d wave, sharing the small hours of new babies. They had propped one another up through pregnancy and the first weeks and went on doing so now, meeting almost every day, walking their buggies together, swapping notes. It had made all the difference. St Luke&#x2019;s Road was in the grid of small Victorian terraced houses known as the Apostles, friendly, neighbourly, and near to the shops, coffee bars and restaurants of Lafferton&#x2019;s centre. They were lucky, Jess thought as she dropped the curtain, even if the houses were small. She hated the idea of being stuck out in the sticks, even with bigger rooms and a garden, but no life nearby and needing a car to get you anywhere. They couldn&#x2019;t afford a car. Matt walked to work.</p><p>The Green bedroom was in darkness, the moon shining on quiet pavements, but as she turned, Jess thought she saw something move. Turned back and lifted the curtain again. No. Trick of the light. Nothing. And then her hand went to her mouth. Noah was grizzling himself back to sleep but she barely noticed.</p><p>Matt was hard to wake and when he did, he stumbled out of bed assuming he had to pick up the baby and was almost able to do so in his sleep.</p><p>He came awake fully as Jess shook his arm.</p><p>&#x2018;What? You&#x2019;ve been dreaming &#x2013;&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;NO. Matt, go down, go out there ... I was not dreaming. You&#x2019;ve got to go.&#x2019; Noah cried again as her voice rose. She picked him up and sat on the edge of the bed, putting him to the breast and gesturing to Matt to hurry.</p><p>It was not that he refused to believe her, just that he was still not fully awake, and he felt foolish, standing half dressed and in slippers, looking up and down St Luke&#x2019;s Road and seeing nothing, Nothing at all. But she had been wide awake and he knew that she thought she had seen ...</p><p>And then he saw.</p><p>The child was squatting down behind the gate of a house opposite.</p><p>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s OK,&#x2019; Matt said. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s all right, it&#x2019;s all right.&#x2019;</p><p>He went through the gate and stopped. Later, he said that he would never forget the child&#x2019;s face until his dying day. Later, he could not sleep because the face was in front of him. Later, he was haunted during his waking hours by sudden flashbacks to the child&#x2019;s face as it looked up at him.</p><p>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s all right. Dear God. Listen, I won&#x2019;t hurt you. I&#x2019;m going to look after you, OK?&#x2019; But even as he spoke, gently, quietly, the child tried to shrink into a hedge, as if it might find a safe place among the rough bare twigs and earth.</p><p>Very slowly, Matt inched his way, his hand out, talking softly in what he desperately hoped was a voice of reassurance. The child continued to shrink from him and now it turned its face away from him out of fear.</p><p>It was a girl. She was perhaps four years old. She was filthy, she had smears of blood on her arms and legs. Her long, fine, fair hair was matted to her scalp. She was completely naked.</p><p>There was silence and stillness and fear for long minutes before the child lurched forward, the hedge catching at her again as she moved and drawing fresh pinpoints of blood, and then she was clinging to Matt, climbing up him like a terrified small animal and pressing her little body to him. He put his arm round her carefully and edged backwards down the path. She did not move, only clung fast to him. Matt hurried across the road, back into the house, calling to Jess. But she had already seen him through the window and only seconds later, blue lights turning, the police car stopped outside.</p><p><i>Two</i></p><p>MAY 2007</p><p>Year 2 at St Luke&#x2019;s Primary School had been talking about Things I Like and Things I Don&#x2019;t Like, as part of the week&#x2019;s topic on food and drink. Sue Norwood had found it informative. Most of the likes were as expected &#x2013; sweet things, crisps, sometimes the odd grape &#x2013; and the dislikes she could have predicted &#x2013; milk, green vegetables, stew, runny egg. The next part of the topic would be more challenging &#x2013; why we should try the things we don&#x2019;t like again, in case we find we do like them after all. Why we shouldn&#x2019;t eat too many sweets, even if we like them very much. Why our bodies need a variety of foods, including green vegetables ... they would dutifully chant the &#x2018;dislikes&#x2019; list and promise to try them again, go home and forget all about it. They would still come to school each morning carrying a half-empty pack of sticky sweets and an egg would never pass their lips. Some of them had even picked up on the words &#x2018;wheat&#x2019; and &#x2018;dairy&#x2019; in the same breath as the words &#x2018;allergy&#x2019; and &#x2018;intolerance&#x2019;.</p><p>But they were still one of the best classes she had ever taught, alert, funny, loyal to one another and relatively well behaved. One or two had problems, including the boy who still wore nappies and the girl who never spoke, problems which were not easy to solve, and ought to involve the parents.</p><p>Sue sighed. She knew that the parents of the boy who still wore nappies would never come through the school gates, let alone come to see her.</p><p>The silent child was sitting at the far end of the second table now, head bent to the paper so that her face was barely visible. Glory Dorfner. There were some colourful names in Years 1 and 2 but what parent called their child &#x2018;Glory&#x2019;? And why not? she asked herself smartly. Better than ... well, better than quite a few.</p><p>The classroom was quiet, apart from the odd sniff, cough and shuffle. They were drawing and labelling with some glee six things they disliked to eat or drink. She stood behind Alfie Starman. His ears needed a wash, but his careful picture of a cabbage was very good indeed and she said so. Alfie glanced round, flushed with pride and pleasure. Rikki O&#x2019;Mara kicked him in the shin. But, as Rikki would have said, if challenged, &#x2018;in a good way, Mrs Norwood&#x2019;. She had a soft spot for Rikki.</p><p>Glory bent her head even further and her arm was curved across the paper to hide it. Sue waited a moment. She could feel the child&#x2019;s tension.</p><p>&#x2018;May I see?&#x2019;</p><p>Glory shook her head slightly.</p><p>&#x2018;Shall I guess?&#x2019;</p><p>The child was absolutely still.</p><p>&#x2018;You don&#x2019;t like &#x2013; chips?&#x2019; Shouts from all sides, arms waving. Everyone liked chips. &#x2018;All right, I know. Chip pictures, all of you.&#x2019;</p><p>Much giggling.</p><p>&#x2018;But maybe Glory doesn&#x2019;t like chips.&#x2019;</p><p>Silence.</p><p>&#x2018;I think you don&#x2019;t like &#x2013; tea?&#x2019;</p><p>Silence.</p><p>&#x2018;Tomatoes?&#x2019;</p><p>Sue did not continue. She waited a moment, went round three others, looking, admiring, querying. Then got a spare low chair and sat next to Glory. But the child was immovable. She said nothing. Would not lift her arm.</p><p>It was early evening before she finally opened the big folder containing Year 2&#x2019;s work, setting the pile on the table next to a box of gold paper stars. Alice was marking Year 12 English essays, swearing from time to time.</p><p>&#x2018;OFFS, Damian Cross, try reading the text.&#x2019;</p><p>Sue smiled, and turned over the next sheet.</p><p>For a second, she thought it had ended up in her folder by mistake, except that she could not possibly imagine how.</p><p>Glory could barely write and what she did manage was still in mirror-writing. Well, that would sort itself out, it always did.</p><p>&#x2018;<i>I don&#x2019;t like</i> ...&#x2019; was in smudged dark pastel, large letters copied in almost violently.</p><p>Sue felt her face flush as she looked at the drawing.</p><p>Then she called Alice over.</p><p>&#x2018;Police,&#x2019; Alice said almost immediately.</p><p>&#x2018;What on earth can they do?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Or family welfare officers ... NSPCC? I don&#x2019;t know, but you&#x2019;ve got to show this to someone.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Maybe Glory&#x2019;s parents ...&#x2019;</p><p>Alice gave her a look.</p><p>&#x2018;No, you&#x2019;re right.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Take it to Eleanor first thing, cover your back. Let her decide.&#x2019;</p><p>Alice went back to the essays on <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>, muttering as usual about wishing they could read a more challenging novel, vowing yet again to start them on <i>Great Expectations</i> the moment they were done with the set text.</p><p>Glory&#x2019;s picture seemed to come in front of every one of the others that she looked at. She gave up. Turned on the news.</p><p>&#x2018;I wonder if they&#x2019;ve found out about that little girl yet?&#x2019;</p><p>Alice just nodded, head down in her essays.</p><p>&#x2018;Look at me,&#x2019; Sue said, hands on the table in front of her.</p><p>Alice looked.</p><p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m seriously worried about this child.

For Waltheof of Huntingdon, however, rebellion is not at the forefront of his thoughts. From the moment he catches sight of Judith, daughter of the King&#39;s formidable sister, he knows he has found his future wife. When Waltheof saves Judith&#39;s life, it is clear that the attraction is mutual. But marriage has little to do with love in mediaeval Europe. William refuses to let the couple wed and Waltheof joins an uprising against him. William crushes the rebellion but decides the best way to keep Waltheof in check is to agree to the marriage. But is the match between Saxon earl and Norman lady one made in heaven or hell? As their children grow, Waltheof and Judith must choose between their feelings for each other and older loyalties. Based on an astonishing true story, THE WINTER MANTLE reaches from the turbulent reign of William the Conqueror to the high drama of the crusades.</p><p>Praise for <i>Elizabeth Chadwick</i><br><br>&#x201c;An author who makes history come gloriously alive&#x201d;<br>---<i>The Times</i> [U.K.] <br><br>&#x201c;Reading an Elizabeth Chadwick novel is the next best thing to time travel.&#x201d;<br>---Sharon Kay Penman<br><br>Praise for <i>Lords of the White Castle </i><br><br> &#x201c;A lively, well-plotted drama, superior to the norm.&#x201d;<br>---<i>Publishers Weekly</i> <br><br>Praise for <i>The Marsh King&#x2019;s Daughter</i><br> <br>&#x201c;This novel has everything---adventure, treachery, violence, and some forthright sex, but its abiding strength is the author&#x2019;s grasp of the historical details.&#x201d;<br>---Beverly Guardian <br><br>&#x201c;Beautifully written with marvelously drawn characters and fascinating details that bring the late medieval period wonderfully to life.

In this provocative work, David Yoo broadens the scope of Japanese-American history beyond its usual confines to examine how the second generation&#x2014;the Nisei&#x2014;has shaped its identity and negotiated its place within American society.&nbsp;&nbsp; Framed by the Immigration Act of 1924, which effectively curtailed migration from Japan to the United States, and the Tokyo Rose treason trial of 1949, <i>Growing Up Nisei</i> traces the emergence of a dynamic Nisei subculture and shows how the foundations laid during the 1920s and 1930s helped many Nisei adjust to the upheaval of the concentration camps. Yoo demonstrates that schools, racial-ethnic churches, and the immigrant press served not merely as waystations to assimilation but as tools by which Nisei affirmed their identity in connection with both Japanese and American culture.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rather than a simple choice between two alternatives, identity formation for the Nisei who came of age during the war entailed negotiating multiple meanings related to race, gender, class, generation, the economy, politics, and international relations. A thoughtful consideration of the gray area between accommodation and resistance, <i>Growing Up Nisei</i> attests to a complexity of experience and context that foregoes one-dimensional cardboard figures and moves toward a portrayal of Japanese Americans as fully human.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><p>&#34;Readable, carefully organized, and well researched.&#34; -- Choice &#34;Confronts issues regarding racism, gender, religion, education, and employment during the first half of the 20th century in California. Yoo takes an extraordinary glimpse at the complexities of a dual society and establishes a thoughtful analyzation both a historical and a cultural context.&#34; -- Erin L. Carter, Journal of the West &#34;Yoo has wrought a lively and innovative portrait of California&#39;s Nisei, the second generation Japanese Americans. Treating the decades between the pasage of the 1924 Immigration Act and the 1949 trial of Iva Toguri, Yoo&#39;s account is knit together by a careful examination of Nisei discourses on identity that occurred in and around key community institutions: ethnic schools, churches, and the vernacular press.&#34; -- James J. Rawls, California History &#34;Sharply focused and well written, this scholarly monograph analyzes the &#39;niche culture&#39; developed by California&#39;s Nisei community between the Immigration Act of 1924, which ended further Japanese migration, and the post-World War II adjustment to the incarceration of the Japanese-American community.&#34; -- Dennie E. Showalter, Multicultural Review &#34;What did it mean to live as a young Japanese American in California from the 1920s through World War II?

The moment Pauline, a stranger to the Polish Eastern Avenue neighborhood of Baltimore (though she lived only twenty minutes away), walked into his mother&#x2019;s grocery store, Michael was smitten. And in the heat of World War II fervor, they are propelled into a hasty wedding. But they never should have married.<br><br>Pauline, impulsive, impractical, tumbles hit-or-miss through life; Michael, plodding, cautious, judgmental, proceeds deliberately. While other young marrieds, equally ignorant at the start, seemed to grow more seasoned, Pauline and Michael remain amateurs. In time their foolish quarrels take their toll. Even when they find themselves, almost thirty years later, loving, instant parents to a little grandson named Pagan, whom they rescue from Haight-Ashbury, they still cannot bridge their deep-rooted differences. Flighty Pauline clings to the notion that the rifts can always be patched. To the unyielding Michael, they become unbearable. <br><br>From the sound of the cash register in the old grocery to the counterculture jargon of the sixties, from the miniskirts to the multilayered apparel of later years, Anne Tyler captures the evocative nuances of everyday life during these decades with such telling precision that every page brings smiles of recognition. Throughout, as each of the competing voices bears witness, we are drawn ever more fully into the complex entanglements of family life in this wise, embracing, and deeply perceptive novel.</p><p>Anne Tyler's <i>The Amateur Marriage</i> is not so much a novel as a really long argument. Michael is a good boy from a Polish neighborhood in Baltimore; Pauline is a harum-scarum, bright-cheeked girl who blows into Michael's family's grocery store at the outset of World War II. She appears with a bloodied brow, supported by a gaggle of girlfriends. Michael patches her up, and neither of them are ever the same. Well, not the same as they were before, but pretty much the same as everyone else. After the war, they live over the shop with Michael's mother till they've saved enough to move to the suburbs. There they remain with their three children, until the onset of the sixties, when their eldest daughter runs away to San Francisco. Their marriage survives for a while, finally crumbling in the seventies. If this all sounds a tad generic, Tyler's case isn't helped by the characteristics she's given the two spouses. Him: repressed, censorious, quiet. Her: voluble, emotional, romantic. Mars, meet Venus. What marks this couple, though, and what makes them come alive, is their bitter, unproductive, tooth-and-nail fighting. Tyler is exploring the way that ordinary-seeming, prosperous people can survive in emotional poverty for years on end. She gets just right the tricks Michael and Pauline play on themselves in order to stay together: "How many times," Pauline asks herself, "when she was weary of dealing with Michael, had she forced herself to recall the way he'd looked that first day? The slant of his fine cheekbones, the firming of his lips as he pressed the adhesive tape in place on her forehead." Only in antogonism do Michael and Pauline find a way to express themselves. <i>--Claire Dederer</i>Anne Tyler was born in Minneapolis in 1941 but grew up in Raleigh, North Carolina.

In these powerfully exotic novels he drew upon his own experience as one of the leading foreign correspondents from the 40s to the 60s working on the Daily Mail. He was the first Briton to reach the South Pole since Scott, was stabbed five times while covering the wars in Morocco and was shot during the Hungarian uprising. He died in 1988.Veteran journalist and novelist Barber (Sakkara, A Farewell to Paris isn't strikingly original in either plot or style, yet he tells an entertaining, old-fashioned sort of tale, much like a Nevil Shute story. Kit Masters, a young British doctor, has been dispatched to the remote South Sea isle of Koraloona after an embarrassing incident in London. In this tropical paradise, he is involved in a number of local intrigues, medical challenges as he copes with young polio victims and a cholera epidemic, and a romance with a young Polynesian who is the granddaughter of Gauguin. The artist, or more precisely, his paintings, play a prominent and interesting part in the plot. Removed from the world, yet touched by all that happens, especially the outbreak of World War II, Masters and his fellow islanders battle natural and man-made calamities with pluck and ingenuity in this charming, if rather lightweight, adventure. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>David Copperfield</h2><p>Beginning in 1854 up through to his death in 1870, Charles Dickens abridged and adapted many of his more popular works and performed them as staged readings. This version, each page illustrated with lovely watercolor paintings, is a beautiful example of one of these adaptations. Because it is quite seriously abridged, the story concentrates primarily on the extended family of Mr. Peggotty: his orphaned nephew, Ham; his adopted niece, Little Emily; and Mrs. Gummidge, self-described as &#34;a lone lorn creetur and everythink went contrairy with her.&#34; When Little Emily runs away with Copperfield&#39;s former schoolmate, leaving Mr. Peggotty completely brokenhearted, the whole family is thrown into turmoil. But Dickens weaves some comic relief throughout the story with the introduction of Mr. and Mrs. Micawber, and David&#39;s love for his pretty, silly &#34;child-wife,&#34; Dora. Dark nights, mysterious locations, and the final destructive storm provide classic Dickensian drama. Although this is not David Copperfield in its entirety, it is a great introduction to the world and the language of Charles Dickens.</p><p>Please note that this is an MP3-CD. This is also available on cassette.<p> In a preface to this novel, Dickens described David Copperfield as his &#x201c;favorite child,&#x201d; and the story has remained among the favorites of Dickens&#x2019; readers, too, with the characters of Betsy Trotwood, Mr. Pegotty, Uriah Heep, and Wilkins Micawber as well as David himself becoming part of the fabric of Western culture. This facsimile reprint is of the <em>Household Edition of the Works of Charles Dickens</em>, published in the 1870s; the edition makes the work available again in a form in which tens of thousands of Victorians read it&#x2015;in two-column format, interspersed with illustrations throughout. </p> <p> <em>David Copperfield</em> was originally published in nineteen monthly parts between May 1, 1849 and November 1, 1850.* Each part except the last was of roughly the same length; the final installment was approximately twice as long as the others (and sold for 2 shillings, twice the price of previous parts). For the original serial publication, as well as early publication in book form, <em>David Copperfield</em> was illustrated by Hablot Browne (more commonly known as &#x201c;Phiz&#x201d;). </p> <p> Shortly after Dickens&#x2019; death in 1870 the British publisher Chapman &amp; Hall began to issue the <em>Household Edition of the Works of Charles Dickens</em> (not to be confused with the American <em>Household Edition of the Works</em>, which appeared in the 1860s). The principal illustrator for the edition was Fred Barnard, and the Dalziel brothers (the leading wood-engravers of the time) created the engravings from Barnard&#x2019;s illustrations; they described <em>The Household Edition</em> as &#x201c;by far the most important commission ever placed in our hands by Messrs. Chapman &amp; Hall.&#x201d; Volumes in <em>The Household Edition</em> began to appear in 1871, and the series was completed in 1879. Dickens&#x2019; works appeared in a great many Victorian editions (including numerous pirated ones). Scholars have understandably paid most attention to the earliest publication in serial form; <em>The Household Edition</em> may well have been the most popular form in which the novel appeared, however; the plates for <em>The Household Edition</em> were widely used for other editions as well, and it is certainly arguable that more Victorian readers would have read Dickens&#x2019; novels in this form than in any other. In 1911 the populist bibliophile J.A. Hammerton described <em>The Household Edition</em> as &#x201c;the most important illustrated edition&#x201d; of Dickens&#x2019; works. </p> <p> This is one of a series from Broadview Press of facsimile editions&#x2015;editions that provide readers with a direct sense of these works as the Victorians themselves experienced them. </p> <p> The breaks were as follows: I &#x2013; May 1849 (chs. 1&#x2013;3); II &#x2013; June 1849 (chs. 4&#x2013;6); III &#x2013; July 1849 (chs. 7&#x2013;9); IV &#x2013; August 1849 (chs. 10&#x2013;12); V &#x2013; September 1849 (chs. 13&#x2013;15); VI &#x2013; October 1849 (chs. 16&#x2013;18); VII &#x2013; November 1849 (chs. 19&#x2013;21); VIII &#x2013; December 1849 (chs. 22&#x2013;24); IX &#x2013; January 1850 (chs. 25&#x2013;27); X &#x2013; February 1850 (chs. 28&#x2013;31); XI &#x2013; March 1850 (chs. 32&#x2013;34); XII &#x2013; April 1850 (chs. 35&#x2013;37); XIII &#x2013; May 1850 (chs. 38&#x2013;40); XIV &#x2013; June 1850 (chs. 41&#x2013;43); XV &#x2013; July 1850 (chs. 44&#x2013;46); XVI &#x2013; August 1850 (chs. 47&#x2013;50); XVII &#x2013; September 1850 (chs. 51&#x2013;53); XVIII &#x2013; October 1850 (chs. 54&#x2013;57); XIX-XX &#x2013; November 1850 (chs. 58&#x2013;64). </p></p><h2>The Art of Wandering: The Writer as Walker</h2><p><p><b>A&nbsp;philosophical history of that strange but prolific hybrid&#x2014;the writer as walker</b></p><p>From the peripatetic philosophers of Ancient Greece to the streets of 20th-century London, Paris, and New York, the figure&nbsp;of writer as walker&nbsp;has continued to evolve through the centuries, the philosopher and the Romantic giving way to the experimentalist and radical. From pilgrim to pedestrian, fl�neur to stalker, the names may change, but the activity of walking remains constant, creating a literary tradition encompassing philosophy and poetry, the novel and the manifesto; a tradition which this book explores in detail. Today, as the figure of the wanderer returns to the forefront of the public imagination, writers and walkers around the world are reengaging with the ideas which animated earlier generations&#x2014;for the walker is once again on the march, mapping new territory and recording new visions of the landscape.</p></p><p><b>Merlin Coverley</b> is a writer and bookseller. He is the author of Pocket Essentials <i>London Writing</i>,<i> Occult London</i>, <i>Psychogeography</i>, and <i>Utopia</i>.*Starred Review* &#x201c;My only comfort is, in Motion,&#x201d; claimed Charles Dickens in 1857. Bookseller Coverley (London Writing, 2005; Occult London, 2008; Psychogeography, 2006; Utopia, 2010) invites readers on an engaging and fascinating stroll through the cultural history of walking. Presenting in chronological order a rich ensemble of writers from diverse parts of the literary spectrum, Coverley expertly demonstrates the varied representations of walkers, from pilgrim and pedestrian to tourist and wayfarer. The first chapters trace the earliest literary accounts of walking from its biblical roots in Adam and Eve&#x2019;s expulsion from Eden and Abel&#x2019;s nomadism to its philosophical traditions. Selected works by Virgil, Horace, and Homer exemplify the &#x201c;integral role the act of walking plays in the classical canon,&#x201d; as do writings from Aristotle&#x2019;s Athenian school, Saint Thomas Aquinas, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. In succeeding chapters, Coverley critically examines the pilgrimages of Dante, Chaucer, Whitman, and Wordsworth while focusing on the central motifs of journey, opportunity, nature, and the imagination. Most compelling is the chapter devoted to the fl�neur, in which the wanderings of Baudelaire (&#x201c;Paris becomes a book to be read by walking her streets&#x201d;) and Virginia Woolf&#x2019;s Mrs. Dalloway (who &#x201c;positively leaps&#x201d; through the streets of central London) are celebrated. Splendid, scholarly, and suffused with evocative stories and biographical sketches, Coverley&#x2019;s book not only proffers pleasure and diversion but also potently explores the historical significance of the art of walking. --Miriam Tuliao</p><h2>Department 56 Villages 2001: Collector&#39;s Value Guide : The Heritage Village Collection : The Original Snow Village Collection</h2><p>Handy value guide for the Department 56 Villages Collector,informative and a value must have item.</p><p></p><h2>50 Favorite Rooms by Frank Lloyd Wright</h2><p>These spectacular rooms, the best-loved interiors from all of Wright&#39;s prodigious architectural achievements, show his trademark design techniques.

With unfinished business in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and the nation suddenly on a bullett train to combat in Iraq, Matt is abruptly given an obscure assignment in China and the Phillipines. As he sifts through the wreckage of a destroyed C-130 aircraft in the Phillipine jungle, he finds a dead U.S. Special Forces paratrooper and begins to question the path that placed him on the periphery of the Global War on Terror. Pursued by a militia of Muslim insurgents, Matt stumbles upon a weapons factory guarded by Japanese soldiers in the uncharted rain forests of Mindanao. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Matt, his brother, U.S. Army Captain Zachary Garrett, is rapidly deployed with his infantry company to guard an ammunition stockpile in an old US Navy base near Manila.

He was a well-known biographer and children&#39;s writer, and worked previously as a producer at the BBC. He wrote biographies of J. R. R. Tolkien, W. H. Auden, Benjamin Britten, Ezra Pound, C. S. Lewis and Dennis Potter. Among his many books for children were the best-selling Mr Majeika series. He also wrote several plays for the theatre and radio. A keen musician, he was a member of a 1930s-style jazz band, Vile Bodies, which was resident at the Ritz Hotel in London for a number of years. He died in 2005.Dubbed the "Lost Generation" by Gertrude Stein, they were Americans who flocked to Paris in the post-WW I years, convinced that in the bohemian quarter of Montparnasse their creativity would flourish. Principal among them was Hemingway, who has the major share of this collective portrait by Carpenter, who also has written biographies of Auden and Tolkien. He follows the evolution of the Hemingway style"no fat, no adjectives, no adverbs"in anecdotes that reveal the personality of a not entirely likable man. Sherwood Anderson, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Kay Boyle, Djuna Barnes, Pound, Joyce and others who frequented the Shakespeare and Company bookstore or the art-filled rooms of Stein also contributed to the "long, wild party" whose glamour has not faded. In this social history, Carpenter illuminates as well the dark side of the heady period.

It developed concurrently everywhere, and every region had it's own identity. But it was in San Francisco and L.A. where the most radical behavior in stateside punk rock style and attitude was exhibited. It was anti-hippie, anti-disco, anti-parent and anti-"nice". And it was shockingly new.

Some of the more celebrated individuals of punk legend featured in this book are Darby Crash, Iggy Pop, Lydia Lunch, Sid Vicious, John Waters, Bruce Connor and members of X, The Cramps, The Avengers, Flipper, The Screamers, The Nuns, and many others.</p><h2>Nell Hill&#39;s O Christmas Tree</h2><p>Mary Carol Garrity and her home furnishing emporium Nell Hill's have become synonymous with delivering creative and stylish advice on all facets of home decorating and entertaining.

Trump? To truly understand America&#x2019;s forty-fifth president, argues <em>Vanity Fair </em>journalist Emily Jane Fox, you must know his children, whose own stories provide the key to unlocking what makes him tick. <em>Born Trump </em>is Fox&#x2019;s dishy, deeply reported, and richly detailed look at Trump&#x2019;s five children (and equally powerful son-in-law, Jared Kushner), exploring their lives, their roles in the campaign and administration, and their dramatic and often fraught relationships with their father and with one another.</p><p>Reexamining the tabloid-soaked events that shaped their lives in startling new detail, <em>Born Trump </em>is full of surprising insights, previously untold stories, and delicious tidbits about their childhoods (ridiculously privileged and painful, in equal measure) and the extraordinary power they now wield. As a version of this new kind of American royalty they wish to be, they are ensconced not in palaces but in Trump Tower and the White House.</p><p>Even before Trump&#x2019;s oldest child, Don Jr., was born, Donald told friends that he wanted at least five kids&#x2014;to make sure there was a greater probability one would turn out just like him. His vision didn&#x2019;t pan out exactly as he&#x2019;d imagined, but Trump&#x2019;s children each inherited some of his essential traits&#x2014;as one source says, &#x201c;collectively, they make the whole.&#x201d;</p><p>Ivanka is a media-savvy, hyperskilled messenger with her father&#x2019;s self-promotional ease but without the brash.</p><p>Don Jr. has the most contentious relationship with his father yet seems prone to endlessly repeat his mistakes.</p><p>Eric embraced the family&#x2019;s real estate business but has, in surprising ways, charted a more independent course than his siblings.</p><p>While Tiffany grew up mostly separate from her father, she inherited Trump&#x2019;s perspective as an outsider&#x2014;his unique combination of assurance and insecurity.</p><p>And there is Ivanka&#x2019;s husband, Jared Kushner, whose own family drama and personal ambition is a crucial thread in this saga.</p><p>Come for the vision of Trump as a father&#x2014;a portrait of the president at his kindest and cruelest.

When beleaguered chief of police Arly Hanks hears that her mother, Ruby Bee, and best friend, Estelle Oppers, are headed for Memphis on an Elvis Pilgrimage, she thinks she may be getting a long-overdue break. But before she can say &#34;Thank you, thank you very much,&#34; the trip is completely stalled by a variety of deadly doings. Estelle calls home to report that Ruby Bee has collapsed and is in the local hospital. And even before Arly&#39;s seen the delta dawn, one of the other clients on the tour takes a fatal plunge from the hotel balcony -- which adjoins the room of a prominent Maggody citizen, who&#39;s now doing the Jailhouse Rock in the local pen. What&#39;s more, Estelle&#39;s all shook up that the tour van is being followed by ominous thugs. For Arly, it&#39;s now or never, because if her suspicious mind doesn&#39;t figure out what to do quickly, residents of Maggody may be returned to sender -- in a hearse.</p><p>Just when it seems that the denizens of Maggody, Arkansas, and their chief of police, Arly Hanks, have seen everything, author Joan Hess manages to find a way to embroil them in yet another hilarious adventure. This time around, Ruby Bee, Estelle, and their big hair have embarked on a cut-rate package tour to Graceland to pay homage to the King. Before the end of the tour, one of the other pilgrims is found dead outside her hotel room, Ruby Bee is in the hospital, and Mayor Jim Bob Buchanon has been arrested for murder. Arly drives through the night to bring order out of chaos and make sure all the citizens of Maggody return home safely--with or without their dignity intact. As usual, there are more laughs than at a log-rolling festival--Brother Verber's hymn listing sins from A to Z (to the tune of <i>Gilligan's Island</i>) is particularly choice. <p> Joan Hess has made quite a reputation for herself and garnered several awards (including Agatha and Anthony nominations) with this series set in a wide spot in the road in northwest Arkansas. <i>Misery Loves Maggody</i> is the 11th and continues the saga of the dull-witted Buchanons, the Voice of the Almighty Lord Assembly Hall, and Arly herself. Typically, the murders and Arly's (occasionally muddled) course to their solution are really the icing on the cake of these rich parodies of <i>Southern Living</i>. Although Hess's wit is a bit sharper when her cast of characters sticks closer to home, as they do in <i>Martians in Maggody</i> or <i>Miracles in Maggody</i>, an Elvis sighting or two fits right in with the general wackiness and lovable mayhem. <i>--K.A. Crouch</i></p><b>Joan Hess</b> has written twenty-two mysteries for which she has received numerous awards, including the American Mystery Award, the Agatha Award, the Drood Review Readers' Award, and the McCavity Award. A former President of the American Crime Writers League, she is currently President of the Arkansas Mystery Writers Alliance.

The author of many literary novels and stories in practically every genre, his novels have won and been shortlisted for numerous awards including the Hugo, Nebula, World Fantasy, Whitbread and Guardian Fiction Prize. In 1999, he was given the World Fantasy Life Achievement Award; in 2001, he was inducted into the SF Hall of Fame; and in 2007, he was named a SFWA Grandmaster. Michael Moorcock is also a musician who has performed since the seventies with his own band, the Deep Fix; and, as a member of the prog rock band, Hawkwind, won a gold disc. His tenure as editor of New Worlds magazine in the sixties and seventies is seen as the high watermark of SF editorship in the UK, and was crucial in the development of the SF New Wave. Michael Moorcock&#39;s literary creations include Hawkmoon, Corum, Von Bek, Jerry Cornelius and, of course, his most famous character, Elric. He has been compared to, among others, Balzac, Dumas, Dickens, James Joyce, Ian Fleming, J.R.R. Tolkien and Robert E. Howard.

But when Donnie, a powerful capo, is relocated to the island the scene is set for an Elmore Leonard-style mix of low life and high comedy.</p><p>Anthony Bourdain is the author of Bone in the Throat, Gone Bamboo, and the non-fiction memoir/deranged rant, Kitchen Confidential. He has been a professional chef for over two decades. His work has appeared in The New Yorker, The New York Times, The Times, The Observer, Scotland on Sunday, The Face, Limb by Limb, Black Book and The Independent. He is a contributing authority for Food Arts magazine. He lives in New York City with his wife, Nancy.For his second course, Bourdain, novelist (Bone in the Throat, 1995) and chef (at Sullivan's, in Manhattan), dishes up a sorry, soggy mess of a stew in which a good-hearted hit man finds himself on the spot with both mob chieftains and law-enforcement agencies. Hired by an ambitious cross-dressing mafioso named Pazz Calabrese to eliminate his two immediate superiors, Henry Denard dispatches one but only wounds the other, D'Andrea (Donnie Wicks) Balistierian aging capo di tutti capi in New York. After returning to Saint Martin, the idyllic West Indian haven he calls home, the hired gun (a decorated Vietnam vet who went on to work for the CIA) learns his wounded target has turned informant and will testify against former partners in crime. What's more, an accommodating interpretation of the Witness Protection Act allows Donnie Wicks (and a small army of US marshals) to take up residence on Saint Martin. Concerned that he and his hardcase wife Frances may have to find another place to live, Henry talks his way inside the former don's compound for a meet. Not to worry, the elderly outlaw has the nothing-personal aspect of gangdom's business down pat, and he soon takes a shine to the professional killer as well as to his lovely, lethal lady. In the meantime, the expatriate godfather's former underlings mount a deadly campaign to silence him. In the wake of a furious assault on his island home (which costs six feds and a like number of Dominican nationals their lives), Donnie Wicks (now under the protection of venal French officials) is reported dead. As a favor to the American authorities cheated of a show trial, Henry heads north to waste the kinky Calabrese and his top lieutenants with a light anti-tank weapon on a New Jersey construction site. At the close, he's drinking and living it up with Frances and Donnie Wicks at his Caribbean hideaway. In the parlance of cuisine: tripe. (Author tour) -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The narrator is the loyal no-nonsense Berthe Duvet, personal maid to the woman who becomes the Duchess of Malvoeux on her marriage to the duke of a beautiful duchy in the Jura mountains of France. Like Camelot, the chateau of the duchy exists out of time: 200 years have passed since the French Revolution, a perilous time for the ducal family when the chateau was sacked and the lands destroyed, but a magic spell has since turned it into a ``fairy kingdom'' where every need is served by ``creatures of magic,'' the weather never varies, and the Baroque palace is filled to the ``rafters with a most sumptuous profusion of treasures.'' A certain Colette, whose short life played a decisive role in the fate of the Malvoeux family, suggests that Berthe write the history of the chateau. And this Berthe proceeds to do, beginning with her childhood in Paris, her service with the young duchess, and their move to this chateau filled with objects collected by a family driven by a passion to possess--a passion that has not escaped the current duke, who collects exotic birds. Meanwhile, French history is also moving at a fast clip, and Berthe adds at length her impressions of those stirring times. She soon learns that there's something dark in the family past. A beggar appears to remind the family of his curse--a curse to be removed only when a white porcelain bird is found. The search is joined, past crimes are finally revealed, the curse is lifted--only to be replaced with a more benign but no less confining enchantment. A dazzling display of period detail, and a slew of authentic- seeming characters--but all disappointingly held in thrall to a narrative that lumbers on to a by-now-longed-for end. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

In addition to symbolizing the clash between evolutionist and creationist camps, the trial helped shape the development of both popular religion and constitutional law in the United States, serving as a precedent for more recent legal and political battles. Pairing new archival material from both the Bryan prosecution and the Darrow defense with Larson's keen historical and legal analysis, <i>Summer for the Gods</i> offers a fresh interpretation of a pivotal event in American history. </p></p><p>If you haven't seen the film version of <i>Inherit the Wind</i>, you might have read it in high school. And even people who have never heard of either the movie or the play probably know something about the events that inspired them: The 1925 Scopes "monkey trial," during which Darwin's theory of evolution was essentially put on trial before the nation. <i>Inherit the Wind</i> paints a romantic picture of John Scopes as a principled biology teacher driven to present scientific theory to his students, even in the teeth of a Tennessee state law prohibiting the teaching of anything other than creationism. The truth, it turns out, was something quite different. In his fascinating history of the Scopes trial, <i>Summer for the Gods</i>, Edward J. Larson makes it abundantly clear that Truth and the Purity of Science had very little to do with the Scopes case. Tennessee had passed a law prohibiting the teaching of evolution, and the American Civil Liberties Union responded by advertising statewide for a high-school teacher willing to defy the law. Communities all across Tennessee saw an opportunity to put themselves on the map by hosting such a controversial trial, but it was the town of Dayton that came up with a sacrificial victim: John Scopes, a man who knew little about evolution and wasn't even the class's regular teacher. Chosen by the city fathers, Scopes obligingly broke the law and was carted off to jail to await trial. <p> What happened next was a bizarre mix of theatrics and law, enacted by William Jennings Bryan for the prosecution and Clarence Darrow for the defense. Though Darrow lost the trial, he made his point--and his career--by calling Bryan, a noted Bible expert, as a witness for the defense. <i>Summer for the Gods</i> is a remarkable retelling of the trial and the events leading up to it, proof positive that truth is stranger than science.</p>Edward J.

He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1929, but was forced by illness to retire from the Navy in 1934. He settled in California and over the next five years held a variety of jobs while doing post-graduate work in mathematics and physics at the University of California. In 1939 he sold his first science fiction story to <b>Astounding</b> magazine and soon devoted himself to the genre. <p> He was a four-time winner of the Hugo Award for his novels <b>Stranger in a Strange Land</b> (1961), <b>Starship Troopers</b> (1959), <b>Double Star</b> (1956), and <b>The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</b> (1966). His <b>Future History</b> series, incorporating both short stories and novels, was first mapped out in 1941. The series charts the social, political, and technological changes shaping human society from the present through several centuries into the future. </p><p> Robert A. Heinlein's books were among the first works of science fiction to reach bestseller status in both hardcover and paperback. he continued to work into his eighties, and his work never ceased to amaze, to entertain, and to generate controversy. By the time hed died, in 1988, it was evident that he was one of the formative talents of science fiction: a writer whose unique vision, unflagging energy, and persistence, over the course of five decades, made a great impact on the American mind.</p></p><h2>South Street: A Photographic Guide to New York City&#39;s Historic Seaport</h2><p>Nineteenth-century prints and contemporary photographs and descriptions of buildings, ships, wharves, and bridges comprise a walking guide to the South Street area of Manhattan</p><p></p><h2>La Boutique Obscure: 124 Dreams</h2><p><b>The beguiling, never-before-translated dream diary of Georges Perec</b><br><br>In&nbsp;<i>La Boutique Obscure</i>&nbsp;Perec once again revolutionized literary form, creating the world&#x2019;s first &#x201c;nocturnal autobiography.&#x201d; From 1968 until 1972&#x2014;the period when he wrote his most well-known works&#x2014;the beloved French stylist recorded his dreams.

Some remember<br>theirs, far fewer recount them, and<br>very few write them down. Why write<br>them down, anyway, knowing you will<br>only sell them out (and no doubt sell<br>yourself out in the process)?<br>&nbsp;<br>I thought I was recording the dreams<br>I was having; I have realized that it was<br>not long before I began having dreams<br>only in order to write them.<br>&nbsp;<br>These dreams&#x2014;overdreamed, overworked,<br>overwritten&#x2014;what could I then<br>expect of them, if not to make them into<br>texts, a bundle of texts left as an o)ering<br>at the gates of that &#x201c;royal road&#x201d; I still<br>must travel with my eyes open?<br>&nbsp;<br>Insofar as I have sought some degree<br>of homogeneity in the transcription and<br>then the composition of these dreams, it<br>seems worth giving a few speci(cations<br>on their typography and formatting:<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2014;a paragraph break corresponds to<br>a change in time, place, feeling, mood,<br>etc., felt as such within the dream;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2014;the use of italics, which is rare, indicates<br>a particularly striking element of<br>the dream;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2014;the greater or lesser size of the gap<br>between paragraphs is meant to correspond<br>to the greater or lesser importance<br>of passages that were forgotten or indecipherable<br>upon waking;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2014;the sign / / indicates an intentional<br>omission.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>No. 1<br>May 1968<br><i>The height gauge</i><br>&nbsp;<br>The height gauge (the name escapes me: metronome, perch) where must stay ad. lib. for several hours. Naturally. The armoire (the two hiding places). The rehearsal. Humiliation. ?. Arbitrary power.<br>&nbsp;<br>A scene with several people. There is a height gauge in the corner. I know I am at risk of having to spend several hours under it; it&#x2019;s an act of bullying rather than real torture, but extremely uncomfortable, because there is nothing holding the top of the gauge and, after a while under it, one might shrink.<br>&nbsp;<br>Naturally, I am dreaming and I know that I am dreaming, naturally, that I am in a prison camp. It&#x2019;s not really a prison camp, of course, but an image of a prison camp, a dream of a prison camp, a prison-camp metaphor, a prison camp I know only as a familiar image, as though I were ceaselessly dreaming the same dream, as though I never dreamed of anything else, as though I never did anything but dream of this prison camp.<br>&nbsp;<br>It&#x2019;s clear that the threat of the gauge is enough, at first, to concentrate in itself all the terror of the camp. And then it seems it&#x2019;s not so bad. In any case, I escape the threat; it doesn&#x2019;t come to pass. But it is precisely my avoidance of this threat that most clearly proves the essence of the camp: the only thing that saves me is the indifference of the torturer, his liberty to do or not to do; I am entirely at the mercy of his arbitrary power (in exactly the same way as I am at the mercy of this dream: I know it is only a dream, but I cannot escape it).<br>&nbsp;<br>The second sequence modifies these themes slightly. Two characters (one is without a doubt myself ) open an armoire in which two hiding spots have been forged, crammed with deportees&#x2019; valuables. By &#x201c;valuables&#x201d; I mean any objects that could increase the safety and chances of survival of their owner, be they bare necessities or objects with some exchange value. The first hiding spot contains woolens, countless woolens, old and moth-eaten and drab. The second hole, which contains money, is made of a rocker device: one of the armoire&#x2019;s shelves is hollow inside and its cover lifts up like that of a school desk. But this little stash seems unsound, and I am just activating the mechanism that opens it to take the money out when someone enters. An officer. In an instant we understand that all of this is useless anyway. It also becomes clear that dying and leaving this room are one and the same.<br>&nbsp;<br>The third sequence could surely, had I not forgotten it completely, have supplied a name for the camp: Treblinka, or Terezienbourg, or Katowice. The performance might have been the <i>Terezienbourg Requiem </i>(<i>Les Temps modernes</i> 196., no., pp. . . .&#x2013;. . .). The moral of this faded episode seems to invoke older dreams: we can save ourselves (sometimes) by playing. . . .<br>&nbsp;<br>No. 2<br>November 1968<br><i>Tiles</i><br>With a laugh that can be described only as &#x201c;sardonic,&#x201d; she began to make passes at a stranger, in my presence. I said nothing. She kept it up, so I eventually left the room.<br>&nbsp;<br>I am in my room with A. and a casual acquaintance, whom I am teaching to play Go. He seems to understand the game, until I realize he thinks he is learning to play bridge. The game actually consists of distributing letter tiles (more like a kind of lotto than a kind of Scrabble).<br>&nbsp;<br>No. 3<br>November 1968<br><i>Itinerary</i><br>: known secret maze, doors of chests (round, armored), hallways, very long trek toward the encounter<br>&nbsp;<br>and then the same path now known to all.<br>&nbsp;<br>No. 4<br>December 1968<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Illusion</i><br>I am dreaming<br>She is beside me<br>I tell myself I&#x2019;m dreaming<br>But the pressure of her hand against mine feels too strong<br>I wake up<br>She really is beside me<br>Delirious joy<br>I turn on the lights<br>Light bursts forth for a hundredth of a second then goes out<br>(a rattling lamp)<br>I embrace her<br>&nbsp;<br>(I wake up: I am alone)<br>&nbsp;<br>No. 5<br>December 1968<br>&nbsp;<br><i>The dentist</i><br>At the end of a maze of covered walkways, a bit like in a souk, I arrive at a dentist&#x2019;s office.<br>&nbsp;<br>The dentist is out but her son, a young boy, is there.

She leads me to the waiting room. I tell her I don&#x2019;t have time. She opens my mouth very wide and bursts into tears as she tells me that all my teeth are rotten but thatit&#x2019;s not worth treating them.<br>&nbsp;<br>My mouth, open wide, is immense. I have an almost palpable sensation of total rot.<br>&nbsp;<br>My mouth is so large, and the dentist so small, that I suspect she is going to put her whole head in my mouth.<br>&nbsp;<br>Later, I run through the shopping mall.

Grant's Wilderness Campaign (March-June 1864) reveals a sure grasp of Civil War history and military strategy. In contrast to Horace Porter's eyewitness classic Campaigning with Grant (1897) and Noah Trudeau's painstakingly detailed Bloody Roads South (Little, Brown, 1989), Lowry's analysis focuses on how the costly Wilderness Campaign integrated into Grant's broader plans for bringing the conflict to a quick and decisive conclusion. Drawn primarily from secondary sources readily available in comprehensive collections, this book is not an essential purchase for academic or large public libraries. However, Lowry's entertaining style and careful documentation should make it an attractive choice for school or small public libraries.<br><i>- Lawrence E. Ellis, Broward Community Coll. Lib., Ft.

Gervase Fen, the Oxford Professor who has been invited to give a speech at the school, is soon in the thick of a mystery that grows deadlier as it becomes more inexplicable. What, if anything, is worth the risk of committing murder?</p><p>Edmund Crispin was the pseudonym of Bruce Montgomery, an English crime writer and composer. He graduated from St John&#39;s College, Oxford, in 1943, with a BA in modern languages, having for two years been its organist and choirmaster. From 1943 to 1945 he taught at Shrewsbury School and in 1944 published the first of nine Gervase Fen novels, The Case of the Gilded Fly. He became a well respected reviewer of crime, writing for the Sunday Times from 1967 until his death in 1978. He also composed the music for many of the Carry On films. From the original editions: &#39;Edmund Crispin&#39;s recreations are swimming, excessive smoking, Shakespeare, the operas of Wagner and Strauss, idleness and cats. His antipathies are dogs, the French Film, the Renaissance of the British Film, psychoanalysis, the psychological-realistic crime story and the contemporary theatre.&#39;A pair of murders keeps Professor Gervase Fen on his tippy toes in this classic 1948 mystery, which takes place at an exclusive British boarding school. Narrator Stephen Thorne romps through the cast of stuffy teachers and hysterical students--enjoying one accent after another. It&#39;s a treat to have such a trustworthy voice narrating, so one can just sit back and enjoy the production. Speech Day at Castrevenford School was never so exciting, and luckily Professor Fen is there to investigate trysts and a kidnapping, as well as a lost Shakespearean manuscript and locket. Luckily too, Stephen Thorne is there to jolly us along.

It is a wedding that will both fulfil the promise of a mad god&#39;s return and see her murdered. Pazel has thwarted the sorcerer who would bring back the god but both sides now face deadlock. Can Thasha be saved? Can the war between two Empires be stopped? THE RATS AND THE RULING SEA is, once again, focused on the giant ancient ship, the CHATHRAND, but now she must brave the terrors of the uncharted seas; the massive storms and the ship swallowing whirlpools and explore lands forgotten by the Northern world, all the time involved in a vicious running battle with a ship half her size but nearly her match. Robert Redick&#39;s new novel takes the reader further into the labyrinthine plots and betrayals that have underscored the trilogy from the beginning. We learn more about the Ixchel as they fight for survival against the Chathrand&#39;s rats, discover more about the true motives of conspirators, live with Thasha and Pazel as they face death and deceit, and as the Chathrand sails into the infamous Ruling Sea.

A week later, conservative pundit Robert Novak revealed in his newspaper column that Ambassador Wilson's wife, Valerie Plame Wilson, was a CIA operative. The public disclosure of that secret information spurred a federal investigation and led to the trial and conviction of Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff, Scooter Libby, and the Wilsons' civil suit against top officials of the Bush administration. Much has been written about the "Valerie Plame" story, but Valerie herself has been silent, until now. Some of what has been reported about her has been frighteningly accurate, serving as a pungent reminder to the Wilsons that their lives are no longer private. And some has been completely false--distorted characterizations of Valerie and her husband and their shared integrity. <p> Valerie Wilson retired from the CIA in January 2006, and now, not only as a citizen but as a wife and mother, the daughter of an Air Force colonel, and the sister of a U.S. marine, she sets the record straight, providing an extraordinary account of her training and experiences, and answers many questions that have been asked about her covert status, her responsibilities, and her life. As readers will see, the CIA still deems much of the detail of Valerie's story to be classified. As a service to readers, an afterword by national security reporter Laura Rozen provides a context for Valerie's own story. </p><p> <i>Fair Game</i> is the historic and unvarnished account of the personal and international consequences of speaking truth to power. </p><p> </p> <br><b>Read the First Chapter from <i>Fair Game</i></b><br><br><b>Joining the CIA</b><br>Our group of five--three men and two women--trekked through an empty tract of wooded land and swamp, known in CIA terms as the "Farm."

Maybe it was just a coincidental convergence. I dreamed I was sitting in an aisle seat of a commercial airliner. Next to me was another passenger, a woman. A hand jostled my headrest, and I looked up to see two young men bearing down on us. They both held pistols. One put his gun to my neck and shot. Then he shot again. I watched, as if from outside my body, as the first bullet entered at an angle and lodged in my throat. Moments later, the second bullet grazed by me and disappeared into the neck of my seatmate. I noticed that I was still alive but unable to speak. Then I woke up. A glorious dawn was filtering through the window blinds of my bedroom in Los Angeles. I described the dream to my boyfriend, in hopes of releasing its grip on my mind. I feared falling asleep and returning to that plane. As we lay there talking, the phone rang.<br>&#x201c;Are you watching television?&#x201d; a friend asked.<br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Go turn on your television.&#x201d;<br>What I saw on the screen only deepened my sensation of being caught in some insane realm beyond reality, unable to wake up. It was a feeling that would linger.<br>My induction into a more willful unreality came later that day, when the phone rang again. A reporter in the Los Angeles bureau of an East Coast newspaper was pursuing a &#x201c;reaction story.&#x201d; I was perplexed&#x2014;he had hardly reached an authority on terrorism. As it turns out, that wasn&#x2019;t his concern. After a couple of vague questions about what this tragedy would &#x201c;mean to our social fabric,&#x201d; he answered his own question with, given the morning&#x2019;s events, a bizarrely gleeful tone: &#x201c;Well, this sure pushes feminism off the map!&#x201d; In the ensuing days, I would receive more calls from journalists on the 9/11 &#x201c;social fabric&#x201d; beat, bearing more proclamations of gender restructuring&#x2014;among them a New York Times reporter researching an article on &#x201c;the return of the manly man&#x201d; and a New York Observer writer seeking comment on &#x201c;the trend&#x201d; of women &#x201c;becoming more feminine after 9/11.&#x201d; By which, as she made clear, she meant less feminist. Women were going to regret their &#x201c;independence,&#x201d; she said, and devote themselves to &#x201c;baking cookies&#x201d; and finding husbands &#x201c;to take care of them.&#x201d;<br>The calls left me baffled. By what mental process had these journalists traveled from the inferno at ground zero to a repudiation of female independence? Why would they respond to terrorist attack by heralding feminism&#x2019;s demise&#x2014;especially an attack hatched by avowed antagonists of Western women&#x2019;s liberation? That a cataclysmic event might eclipse other concerns would hardly seem to warrant special mention. Unremarkably, celebrity scandals, Hollywood marital crises, and the disappearance of government intern Chandra Levy all slipped from the front pages. But my gloating caller and his cohorts weren&#x2019;t talking about the normal displacement of small stories by the big one. Feminist perspectives, and those of independent women more generally, didn&#x2019;t just naturally fade from view after 9/11.<br>In the weeks that followed, I had occasion to see this phenomenon repeated in many different ways. Of all the peculiar responses our culture manifested to 9/11, perhaps none was more incongruous than the desire to rein in a liberated female population. In some murky fashion, women&#x2019;s independence had become implicated in our nation&#x2019;s failure to protect itself. And, conversely, the need to remedy that failure somehow required a distaff correction, a discounting of female opinions, a demeaning of the female voice, and a general shrinkage of the female profile. As it turned out, feminists weren&#x2019;t the only women to be &#x201c;pushed off the map&#x201d;; their expulsion was just the preview for the larger erasures to follow.&nbsp;Within days of the attack, a number of media venues sounded the death knell of feminism. In light of the national tragedy, the women&#x2019;s movement had proved itself, as we were variously informed, &#x201c;parochial,&#x201d; &#x201c;frivolous,&#x201d; and &#x201c;an unaffordable luxury&#x201d; that had now &#x201c;met its Waterloo.&#x201d; The terrorist assault had levied &#x201c;a blow to feminism,&#x201d; or, as a headline on the op-ed page of the Houston Chronicle pithily put it, &#x201c;No Place for Feminist Victims in Post 9-11 America.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The feminist movement, already at low ebb, has slid further into irrelevancy,&#x201d; syndicated columnist Cathy Young asserted. &#x201c;Now that the peaceful life can no longer be guaranteed,&#x201d; military historian Martin van Creveld declared in Newsday, &#x201c;one of the principal losers is likely to be feminism, which is based partly on the false belief that the average woman is as able to defend herself as the average man.&#x201d; In a column titled &#x201c;Hooray for Men,&#x201d; syndicated columnist Mona Charen anticipated the end of the old reign of feminism: &#x201c;Perhaps the new climate of danger&#x2014;danger from evil men&#x2014;will quiet the anti-male agitation we&#x2019;ve endured for so long.&#x201d; New York Times columnist John Tierney held out the same hope. &#x201c;Since Sept. 11, the &#x2018;culture of the warrior&#x2019; doesn&#x2019;t seem quite so bad to Americans worried about the culture of terrorism,&#x201d; he wrote, impugning the supposed feminist &#x201c;determination to put boys in touch with their inner feelings.&#x201d; &#x201c;American males&#x2019; fascination with guns doesn&#x2019;t seem so misplaced now that they&#x2019;re attacking Al Qaeda&#x2019;s fortress,&#x201d; he sniffed. &#x201c;No one is suggesting a Million Mom March on Tora Bora.&#x201d;<br>These were, of course, familiar themes, the same old nostrums marching under a bright new banner. Long before the towers fell, conservative efforts to roll back women&#x2019;s rights had been making inroads, and the media had been issuing periodic pronouncements on &#x201c;the death of feminism.&#x201d; In part, what the attack on the World Trade Center did was foreground and speed up a process already under way. &#x201c;Any kind of conflict at a time of unrest in society typically accentuates the fault lines that already exist,&#x201d; Geeta Rao Gupta, president of the International Center for Research on Women, told the Christian Science Monitor in a story headlined &#x201c;Are Women Being Relegated to Old Roles?,&#x201d; one of the few articles to acknowledge what was happening.3 The seismic jolt of September 11 elevated to new legitimacy the ventings of longtime conservative antifeminists, who were accorded a far greater media presence after the attacks. It also invited closet antifeminists within the mainstream media to come out in force, as a &#x201c;not now, honey, we&#x2019;re at war&#x201d; mentality made more palatable the airing of buried resentments toward women&#x2019;s demands for equal status.<br>What was most striking, and passing strange, was the way feminism&#x2019;s detractors framed their assault. In the fall and winter of 2001, the women&#x2019;s movement wasn&#x2019;t just a domestic annoyance; it was a declared domestic enemy, a fifth column in the war on terror. To the old rap sheet of feminist crimes&#x2014;man hating, dogmatism, humorlessness&#x2014;was added a new &#x201c;wartime&#x201d; indictment: feminism was treason. That charge was made most famously, and most cartoonishly, by Rev. Jerry Falwell. &#x201c;I point the finger in their face and say, &#x2018;You helped this happen,&#x2019;&#x201d; Falwell thundered on 9/12 on the Christian Broadcast Network, addressing his j&#x2019;accuse to &#x201c;the pagans, and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle.&#x201d; By altering traditional gender roles, feminists and their fellow travelers had &#x201c;caused God to lift the veil of protection which has allowed no one to attack America on our soil since 1812.&#x201d; Falwell&#x2019;s outburst struck even his compatriots as unfortunate, or at least unsubtle. But his allegations, sanitized and stripped of their Old Testament terms, would soon be taken up by conservative pundits and in mainstream outlets; old subpoenas would be reissued, upgraded with new counts of traitorous behavior.<br>Post-9/11, feminism&#x2019;s defense of legal abortion was accordingly deemed a Benedict Arnold act. &#x201c;After September 11th the American people are valuing life more and realizing that we need policies to value the dignity and worth of every life,&#x201d; Bush&#x2019;s senior counselor Karen Hughes said on CNN, on the same day as a massive reproductive-rights march was in progress in the capital. In fact, American opposition to abortion was &#x201c;really the fundamental difference between us and the terror network we fight,&#x201d; Hughes stressed. (A curious contention, considering that our assailants were hardly prochoice, but her CNN interviewers let it stand.) Others, like Focus on the Family founder James C. Dobson, stated the equation less decorously. &#x201c;Has God withdrawn his protective hand from the US?&#x201d; he asked on his organization&#x2019;s Web site&#x2014;and answered that God is &#x201c;displeased&#x201d; with America for &#x201c;killing 40 million unborn babies.&#x201d; A thirty-second television commercial likening abortion to terrorism was rushed on the air some weeks after the attack by an antiabortion organization&#x2014;&#x201c;to take advantage of the 9-11 events to press our case for sparing the lives of babies,&#x201d; as the executive director candidly put it.<br>The October 15, 2001, edition of the National Review could have passed for a special issue on the subject of feminist treachery. In &#x201c;Their Amerika,&#x201d; John O&#x2019;Sullivan accused feminists of &#x201c;taking the side of medieval Islamists against the common American enemy. They feel more comfortable in such superior company than alongside a hard-hat construction worker or a suburban golfer in plaid pants.&#x201d; Another article, &#x201c;The Conflict at Home,&#x201d; blamed American feminism&#x2019;s &#x201c;multiculturalist&#x201d; tendencies for allowing Sharia extremism to thrive in the Arab world. And a third piece claimed that women&#x2019;s rights activists have so browbeaten the American military that our armed services have &#x201c;simply surrendered to feminist demands&#x201d; and allowed an insistence on equal opportunity to &#x201c;trump combat effectiveness.&#x201d;<br>As the denouncers made their media rounds, they homed in on two aspects of feminist sedition: women&#x2019;s liberation had &#x201c;feminized&#x201d; our men and, in so doing, left the nation vulnerable to attack. &#x201c;Well, you see, there is a very serious problem in this country,&#x201d; Camille Paglia explained to CNN host Paula Zahn a few weeks after 9/11. Thanks to feminism, Paglia said, &#x201c;men and women are virtually indistinguishable in the workplace.&#x201d; Indeed, especially among the American upper middle class, the man has &#x201c;become like a woman.&#x201d; (Paglia was weirdly, albeit inadvertently, echoing the words of Taliban attorney general Maulvi Jalilullah Maulvizada, who had earlier told a journalist that when women are given freedom, &#x201c;men become like women.&#x201d;) This gender confusion in the workplace would bode ill for our coming conflicts with the Arab world, Paglia warned. &#x201c;There is a kind of a threat to national security here,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I think that the nation is not going to be able to confront and to defeat other countries where the code of masculinity is more traditional.&#x201d;<br>The editors and writers in the centrist media expressed such sentiments more euphemistically&#x2014;as furrow-browed concern that a &#x201c;soft&#x201d; America might not be able to rise to the occasion, that a womanly &#x201c;therapeutic culture&#x201d; would cause the nation to value the feminine ritual of mourning over martial &#x201c;action,&#x201d; that a &#x201c;Band of Brothers&#x201d; ethic, as one newsmagazine put it, could not take root in a female-centered &#x201c;Sex and the City culture.&#x201d; &#x201c;For once, let&#x2019;s have no &#x2018;grief counselors,&#x2019;&#x201d; Time editor Lance Morrow lectured. &#x201c;For once, let&#x2019;s have no fatuous rhetoric about &#x2018;healing.&#x2019;&#x201d; Coddled Americans had let themselves go and needed to &#x201c;toughen up.&#x201d; Our World War II elders say we have &#x201c;become too soft,&#x201d; a story in the San Francisco Chronicle warned. Numerous press reports fixated on a report that bin Laden thought Americans were &#x201c;soft and weak.&#x201d; Beneath the press&#x2019;s incessant fretting lurked anxious questions that all seemed to converge on a single point: would a feminized nation have the will to fight?<br>The conservative commentariat had an answer and wasn&#x2019;t shy about stating it. The problem, according to the opinion makers from Fox News, the Weekly Standard, National Review, and the many right-wing-financed think tanks who seemed to be on endless rotation on the political talk shows after 9/11, was simple: the baleful feminist influence had turned us into a &#x201c;nanny state.&#x201d; In the wake of 9/11, a battle needed to be waged between the forces of besieged masculinity and the nursemaids of overweening womanhood&#x2014;or, rather, the &#x201c;vultures&#x201d; in the &#x201c;Sisterhood of Grief,&#x201d; as American Spectator&#x2019;s January&#x2013;February 2002 issue termed them. &#x201c;When we go soft,&#x201d; Northwestern University psychology professor and American Enterprise scholar David Gutmann warned, &#x201c;there are still plenty of &#x2018;hard&#x2019; peoples&#x2014;the Nazis and Japanese in World War II, the radical Islamists now&#x2014;who will see us as decadent sybarites, and who will exploit, through war, our perceived weaknesses.&#x201d; And why had our spine turned to rubber? The conservative analysis proffered an answer: the femocracy.<br>&#x201c;Our culture has undergone a process that one observer has aptly termed &#x2018;debellicization,&#x2019;&#x201d; former drug czar William Bennett advised in Why We Fight, his 2002 call to arms against the domestic forces that were weakening our &#x201c;resolve.&#x201d; The &#x201c;debellicizers&#x201d; that he identified were, over and over, women&#x2014;a female army of schoolteachers, psychologists, professors, journalists, authors, and, especially, feminists who taught &#x201c;that male aggression is a wild and malignant force that needs to be repressed or medicated lest it burst out, as it is always on the verge of doing, in murderous behavior.&#x201d; Since the sixties and seventies, Bennett wrote, this purse-lipped army had denounced American manhood as &#x201c;a sort of deranged Wild West machismo&#x201d;; it had derided the Boy Scouts &#x201c;as irrelevant, &#x2018;patriarchal,&#x2019; and bigoted&#x201d;; it had infected &#x201c;generations of American children&#x201d; with &#x201c;the principle that violence is always wrong.&#x201d; And with the terrorist attack on our nation, the chicken hawks had come home to roost. &#x201c;Having been softened up, we might not be able to sustain collective momentum in what we were now being called upon to do,&#x201d; Bennett wrote. &#x201c;We have been caught with our defenses down.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s happening now is not pacifism but passivism,&#x201d; National Review&#x2019;s Mark Steyn maintained soon after the attack in an article titled &#x201c;Fight Now, Love Later: The Awfulness of an Oprahesque Response.&#x201d; &#x201c;Passivism&#x201d; was a pathogen that had invaded the body politic&#x2014;and American women were its Typhoid Marys, American men its victims. The women who ruled our culture had induced &#x201c;a terrible inertia filled with feel-good platitudes that absolve us from action,&#x201d; Steyn wrote. He found particularly telling Oprah Winfrey&#x2019;s call, at a post-9/11 prayer service in Yankee Stadium, to &#x201c;love&#x201d; one another. &#x201c;Not right now, Oprah,&#x201d; he instructed. If we were to prevail in the coming war, the nation first needed to unseat this regiment of &#x201c;grief counselors&#x201d; and silence all their &#x201c;drooling about &#x2018;healing&#x2019; and &#x2018;closure.&#x2019;&#x201d; &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t begin &#x2018;healing&#x2019; until the guys have stopped firing.&#x201d;<br>As if feminizing our domestic culture weren&#x2019;t bad enough, the women&#x2019;s movement was also jeopardizing our readiness on the battlefield. &#x201c;Bands of brothers don&#x2019;t need girls,&#x201d; a Rocky Mountain News columnist held, denouncing feminists for depleting the military muscle we would need for the upcoming war on terror. &#x201c;To them, the military is just another symbol of the male patriarchy that ought to be feminized, anyway, along with the rest of society.&#x201d; Our first lady of antifeminism, Ann Coulter, cast this argument in her usual vituperous fashion. &#x201c;This is right where you want to be after Sept. 11&#x2014;complaining about guns...</p><h2>Malice Domestic (#6)</h2><p>Collects seventeen traditional mysteries by such contemporary writers as Marjorie Eccles, Jan Burke, Anthea Fraser, and Edward Marston.

Now in Dragonfly, this is the perfect book for any kid who loves to giggle (and who doesn't?) and parents who love to hear them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><b>Bill Grossman</b> has written numerous books for children.In this zany, cumulative counting book, the narrator's ravenous sister devours?and manages to keep down?some decidedly unorthodox delicacies: "My little sister ate 3 ants./ She even ate their underpants./ She ate 2 snakes. She ate 1 hare./ We thought she'd throw up then and there./ But she didn't." Four shrews (plus their "smelly socks and shoes"), five bats, six mice, seven polliwogs, eight worms and nine lizards don't interfere a whit with the insatiable child's digestive system... until she makes the mistake of eating 10 peas and everything comes back up, alive and well. Yes, Grossman's (Cowboy Ed) concept is, well, gross, but it's certainly of the kid-tickling variety. The rhyme and zippy rhythm never falter as Hawkes's (The Enormous Snore) equally offbeat art shows the widemouthed girl chowing down in some humorous guises: as a snake charmer swallowing her subjects; as a pirate making the doomed shrews walk the plank... into her mouth; as a cowgirl sauteing leaping lizards in a skillet. Other piquant details include the shocked expressions on the tasty victims' faces and the droll words printed on the girl's sweatshirt, "Save the Whales (For Dessert)." For those who are not quick to get queasy, enjoying this feast will surely be easy.

But once in Russia, she quickly becomes entangled in a country she can&#x2019;t escape. Many years later, Florence&#x2019;s son, Julian, immigrates back to the United States, though his work in the oil industry takes him on frequent visits to Moscow. When he learns that Florence&#x2019;s KGB file has been opened, he arranges a business trip to uncover the truth about his mother, and to convince his son, Lenny&#x2014;trying to make his fortune in Putin&#x2019;s cutthroat Russia&#x2014;to return home. What Julian discovers is both chilling and heartbreaking: an untold story of a generation of Americans abandoned by their country, and the secret history of two rival nations colluding under the cover of enmity.<br><br> <i>The Patriots</i> is a riveting evocation of the Cold War years, told with brilliant insight and extraordinary skill. Alternating between Florence&#x2019;s and Julian&#x2019;s perspectives, it is at once a mother-son story and a tale of two countries bound in a dialectic dance; a love story and a spy story; both a grand, old-fashioned epic and a contemporary novel of ideas.

Florence had committed herself to this credo, letting it carry her through the cruelty of the past six weeks&#x2014;so that she was surprised, on the upper deck of the Bremen, to feel her faith recede. From under her narrow palm she gazed down at the people crowding the dock. A May sun accosted the harbor and coated everything with a blinding shine. The air smelled of coal and rotted fish. Small green waves raced from the hull back to the pier, where her parents and her little brother stood squeezed in among strangers. She would have shouted out to them but knew her voice could not carry over the screeches of gulls and the intermittent bassoon of the ship&#x2019;s tremendous whistle.</p><p>Only after she&#x2019;d bought her ticket had Florence told her parents she was leaving. Then she braced herself for the family volcano.</p><p>&#x201c;Cleveland was not enough!&#x201d; Her father&#x2019;s shouts had rattled their Flat- bush living room. &#x201c;Russia! You want to go where they&#x2019;re shooting people dead for eating their own grain?&#x201d;</p><p>She&#x2019;d fought back. &#x201c;No one who&#x2019;s traveled there ever reported seeing any such thing.&#x201d;</p><p>He turned to her mother. &#x201c;Never reported! They&#x2019;re being duped, Florie. And <i>you&#x2019;re</i> being duped.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure, and the factories are only burning straw to make smoke come out the chimneys?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You think I&#x2019;m such a dummy that I don&#x2019;t know what kind of hood- winked world my own father left. A young person such as yourself, ripe for recruitment . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No one has recruited me!&#x201d;</p><p>But his eyes were wild with lunatic distrust. &#x201c;Let me see your Party card!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have one!&#x201d; she shouted, her voice caving from tears. &#x201c;For Pete&#x2019;s sake, I am not a communist!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then why, Florie? Just tell me why. What kind of madness is this, for a girl to want to leave her family, her home, all the people who love her? To the other end of the world!&#x201d;</p><p>She could not tell him the truth. Could not show him the photograph of the dark-eyed man with the Apache cheeks, tucked in the back of her dresser drawer. Better they think her a communist than a nafka. &#x201c;I am not leaving forever, Papa!&#x201d; she said in a voice hoarse from shouting.</p><p>&#x201c;Then tell us how long?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t tell you. A year, maybe more.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And throw away another year of your life?&#x201d; &#x201c;I want to live my life.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Go, then! I&#x2019;ve had enough of you,&#x201d; her father said. &#x201c;May the day never come when you feel the pain we feel now.&#x201d;</p><p>Despite their threats, her parents had come to see her off. Her mother gave Florence her own fur coat to brave the snowy Russian winter. Her father bought her a traveler&#x2019;s trunk. They stood watching as it was tossed by a ship&#x2019;s attendant into the hold, where it took on the size of a matchbox beside all the other cargo&#x2014;enormous boxes and barrels, chrome automobiles, upright pianos. Her brother Sidney had given her his beloved BSA Taylor compass, whose cold beveled edges Florence now dug with torturous pleasure into the soft flesh of her thumb. She&#x2019;d discovered it in her purse only after she boarded the ship. She wanted to walk off the boat and give it back to Sidney, whose muskrat&#x2019;s hard hat of hair was still visible in flashes among the bodies on the dock. But it was too late; the third-class passengers were boarding, blocking the gangway with awkward bundles. Danes, Poles, Germans, stocky in their winter overcoats and rubber boots. With their American children in tow, they were returning to their homelands in search of work. Observing them trudge aboard, Florence suddenly felt she was watching an old Ellis Island film reel flipped by the Depression into reverse: masses of immigrants returning to the ship, being herded backward through that great human warehouse as Lady Liberty waved them goodbye.</p><p>Her reverie was interrupted by an argument on deck. Somebody was demanding to carry a poultry incubator aboard ship rather than abandon it to the hold. Into the fray came the noises of a hen cock crowing in defiance of the third steamer signal. Taking advantage of the clamor and tumult, one of the Poles was making the rounds with a collection box. When he saw a tall, handsome girl in a tailored green suit, he mistook Florence for a wealthy young lady and approached her with a heavily accented speech about penniless deportees. It was impossible to hear the story in the flapping of ropes and echoes from port. She thought she heard her name being called&#x2014;her father&#x2019;s voice a hallucination conjured by the wind&#x2019;s eddies. Florence opened her purse and gave the man a coin.</p><p>She felt ready for the ship to cast off, but a fresh commotion had seized the crowd. On the gangway ramp, a girl of about eighteen had dropped her glasses and was now palming around for them, interrupting her search only to toss angry defenses at those she was holding up behind. In her myopic squint Florence recognized the feral defiance of someone who&#x2019;d learned to carry her awkwardness brazenly. A girl accustomed to being out of place. But it was her physical appearance that most struck Florence. The girl might have been Florence herself&#x2014;younger, shorter, and plumper, but otherwise bearing an almost familial likeness. Her skin was equally pale; her curls, only slightly darker than Florence&#x2019;s, had the strong kink that Florence had learned to tame out of her own hair with relaxers and combs. Someone from the boat was sent to help the girl, and soon her spectacles were retrieved from between the gangplanks. The commotion was drowned out again by a final signal from the ship&#x2019;s heights. The chimneys belched coal smoke, and the engines of the tugboats began to turn. At last the Bremen made its imperceptible slide backward into the Hudson.</p><p>A flock of gulls with black-edged wings circled the ship as it churned and split the water. Slowly by slowly the crowd on the pier receded, her family along with them. Only the gulls stayed close. Trailing the Bremen, they rose and fell on a tunnel of air which seemed to propel the ship and everyone on it down a course that stretched irreversibly into a bright, portentous sea.</p><p>The following morning the sun&#x2019;s rays were unobstructed by any buildings or trees. An ocean chill drew bumps on Florence&#x2019;s arms as she sat on a lounge chair in the scalloped shade of an awning. She drew on her round sunglasses and attempted to read a book she&#x2019;d brought for the journey: Red Virtue: Human Relationships in the New Russia by Ella Winter. Winter&#x2019;s prose was making it hard to get past page 2. And another human relationship was presently competing for her attention: on the top deck, in first class, a tall madam with sunken cheeks and a greyhound&#x2019;s ropy body was promenading on the arm of a much younger, darker-skinned gentleman. The man&#x2019;s hair was gelled back like Valentino&#x2019;s. His spine stayed rigid with military aplomb even as his companion petted his shoulder and brushed his ear with her thin lips.</p><p>&#x201c;So&#x2014;what do you make of her?&#x201d;</p><p>Florence turned to find the girl she&#x2019;d seen the day before. Her tortoise-shell glasses were now affixed firmly on the short bridge of her nose. Atop her curly head a woven beret was tipped at a precarious angle.</p><p>&#x201c;Pardon me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ella Winter. Your book. Another phony Margaret Mead, if you ask me.&#x201d;</p><p>Florence frowned and took a glance at the cover.</p><p>&#x201c;It must have been real disappointing for her to discover her Russians weren&#x2019;t illiterate savages like the Samoans,&#x201d; the girl resumed with no preliminaries.</p><p>&#x201c;Have you read it?&#x201d; Florence said mistrustfully.</p><p>&#x201c;I read all I needed to in the essay they printed in The American. They&#x2019;ll print any so-called scholarship as long as it&#x2019;s penned by Mrs. Lincoln Steffens. You like it?&#x201d;</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t a question so much as a preemptive dismissal of her tastes, and therefore, Florence decided, undeserving of a response. In fact, the book was astonishingly dull. Yet this odd girl&#x2019;s exuberant abrasiveness now</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>compelled Florence to defend it. &#x201c;And what about Dorothy Thompson&#x2014; you won&#x2019;t read her, either, &#x2019;cause she&#x2019;s Mrs. Sinclair Lewis?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What kind of false comparison is that?&#x201d; The girl plopped down on the neighboring lounge chair. &#x201c;Thompson&#x2019;s queen of the press corps. Winter is just another suffragette born twenty years too late.&#x201d;</p><p>The girl&#x2019;s eyes&#x2014;as blue as Florence&#x2019;s own&#x2014;glowed with a lust for de- bate that Florence found all the more irritating having once had it in good measure. She sensed that entering into a conversation with this creature would return her to a version of herself that she had struggled to shed. In high school and college Florence had earned good marks but a part of her knew that the educators she admired did not admire her back. Her history teacher once applauded her to other students as being the kind of girl &#x201c;who could chop down an oak with a baseball bat.&#x201d; She cringed to think how tone deaf she&#x2019;d been to this double-edged praise.</p><p>&#x201c;Why a suffragette?&#x201d; she now inquired with careful nonchalance. &#x201c;The place of the working-class woman is beside the men of her class, not beside women of other classes. It&#x2019;s basic Marx, if she&#x2019;d ever bothered to crack him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;d bothered to crack her, you&#x2019;d see she acknowledges that Marx claims it&#x2019;s only true for societies that haven&#x2019;t eliminated class. Anyway, I&#x2019;m not reading it for the theory.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I knew it! You&#x2019;re heading to Russia, like me.&#x201d; The girl jutted out her hand. &#x201c;Essie Frank.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Florence Fein.&#x201d;</p><p>In less than a minute, Florence was assailed by an artillery of questions. Which class was she traveling? Where was she from? Where had she gone to school? Where did she plan to stay once she arrived in Moscow?</p><p>&#x201c;The Intourist Hotel?&#x201d; Essie sounded horrified. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll fleece you. They overcharge all foreigners.&#x201d; Essie, evidently, would be lodging at a workers&#x2019; dormitory at the Foreign Language Institute, where she already had a job lined up.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m only staying in Moscow till I can get a ticket for Magnitogorsk,&#x201d; Florence said, in a way she hoped both sounded mysterious and discouraging of further inquiry. The Bremen was making stops in Copenhagen, Danzig, and Libau, and Florence had yet to meet anyone who, like her, was disembarking in Latvia and taking the train to Moscow. Judging by her talk, Essie had undertaken the journey with more preparation, carrying extra passport photographs as well as items to trade or gift. Her prepared- ness felt like a challenge to Florence&#x2019;s faith in the future. &#x201c;Magnitogorsk, all the way out in the Urals!&#x201d; Essie said, either impressed by Florence&#x2019;s bravery or stunned by her foolhardiness. &#x201c;Have you got a job there or something?&#x201d;</p><p>Florence was uncertain how to answer. She was hardly sure herself what dream she was pursuing: one of Soviet Mankind, or of one particular dark-eyed Soviet man.</p><p>At that moment, a coterie of passengers from steerage emerged on deck. One of the men waved to Essie.</p><p>&#x201c;Is that your group over there?&#x201d; Florence said.</p><p>Essie seemed embarrassed. &#x201c;No, no, I&#x2019;m not really with them. . . .&#x201d; Having intruded on Florence&#x2019;s privacy, Essie now seemed to be jealously patrolling her own. &#x201c;See, there was a vacancy, and, last minute, I got the ticket on the cheap. . . . They&#x2019;re all getting off at Danzig.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; Florence turned her gaze back to the couple in first class. The greyhound in her silk pajamas was arching her long torso in a swooning laugh, while her tanned and ascotted paramour clutched her waist as if to keep her from throwing out her back. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s like they&#x2019;re posing for pictures,&#x201d; Florence remarked.</p><p>&#x201c;And wouldn&#x2019;t you know it&#x2019;s the press she&#x2019;s trying to escape,&#x201d; Essie said unexpectedly.</p><p>&#x201c;You know who she is?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Everyone on this steamer knows it. It&#x2019;s Mary Woolford, the utilities heiress, and that&#x2019;s her new Alfonse, an Argentine polo player of legendary prowess. Oh, don&#x2019;t look so shocked; he&#x2019;s far too dark to be American. He&#x2019;s husband n�mero tres for her.&#x201d;</p><p>Florence was shocked, not at the shade of the new husband&#x2019;s skin but at Essie&#x2019;s superior command of ship gossip. &#x201c;Look, she just fixed his shirt again.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I hope she doesn&#x2019;t get it greasy after touching his hair,&#x201d; Essie quipped. &#x201c;Ick!&#x201d; they sang in unison, and nearly choked laughing.</p><p>&#x201c;You know what they say,&#x201d; Essie said. &#x201c; &#x2018;From the back a damsel fair, from the front a wrinkled mare.&#x2019; &#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, he does like ponies,&#x201d; Florence said, before a second convulsion of laughter made the two of them collapse, red-faced, in their chairs. Essie removed her glasses and wiped her eyes, and Florence now found herself battling the powerful sensation of feeling won over by this girl, whose dimples looked like they&#x2019;d been poked out with a gimlet.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t look now,&#x201d; Essie said, grabbing Florence&#x2019;s wrist, &#x201c;but there&#x2019;s a couple of Joe Colleges about to waltz over.&#x201d;</p><p>Florence glanced back and recognized two young men in cable sweaters who&#x2019;d been circling the deck since breakfast time. &#x201c;More like Joe Grammar School,&#x201d; she said, then stretched her legs for an extra precious inch of sun, letting the boys get a good look. The two young men consulted each other quietly before making their approach.</p><p>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t mean to lean into your conversation, girls,&#x201d; said the shorter of the two. He had a large-eared, cheerful face. &#x201c;But my friend was convinced you were Norma Shearer.&#x201d;</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t the first time a boy had made the comparison. On her good days, Florence could notice the similarity in the mirror: her deep-set blue- gray eyes, the aquiline profile people called &#x201c;regal,&#x201d; features that hovered somewhere between innocence and arrogance. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be Al Jolson if you want, darling,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;as long as you have a Lucky. We&#x2019;re all out of smokes, as you see.&#x201d; On the courage of the sea air, she sounded like a hardened flirt.</p><p>The young man turned out his pockets. &#x201c;Sorry, Miss Shearer, no gaspers before tournaments, coach&#x2019;s orders. But we could bring you some desert horses from the restaurant. . . .&#x201d;</p><p>And so they did. They said their names were Jack and Brian and they were traveling to Germany with the New Haven Tennis Club, as guests of the Rot-Weiss Tennis Club. With her nail, Florence opened the pack of Camels they&#x2019;d brought and shared one with Essie.</p><p>&#x201c;Russia! That&#x2019;s really jumping the blinds,&#x201d; said Brian when they told him where they were heading. &#x201c;Off to build the Red Paradise?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As a matter of fact,&#x201d; Essie remarked unplayfully.</p><p>The boys gave her a confused smile and turned again to Florence. Whenever Essie opened her mouth, Florence noted, it was plain to see how inadequate she was at saying anything that might hold a man&#x2019;s attention. Soon the boys had to go to practice (somewhere in the ship&#x2019;s labyrinth was a full-sized tennis court), but they asked if the girls would join the team for a drink after dinner. &#x201c;If it isn&#x2019;t past our bedtimes,&#x201d; Florence said, waving them goodbye with a cigarette between her fingers.</p><p>That evening, after the second dinner bell, Florence met Essie in the carpeted hallway outside the Kronprinz Lounge. She took a look at Essie&#x2019;s skirt, and at her shoes, and said, &#x201c;Come with me.&#x201d;</p><p>From the lower berth in Florence&#x2019;s cabin, Essie looked around with un- disguised envy. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got this all to yourself ?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They don&#x2019;t normally sell out of second-class tickets. What&#x2019;s your shoe size?&#x201d;&lt;...</p></p><h2>The Unquiet Ghost: Russians Remember Stalin</h2><p>Explores how Russians--prison survivors, historians, concentration camp guards, and others--are healing the wounds inflicted by long-repressed memories of the former leader and recounts the efforts of many to locate relatives who disappeared during Stalin&#39;s tenure.</p><p>"I was in Moscow during the first shock of Khrushchev's 'secret speech' in 1956, and have followed the long, traumatic process of de-Stalinization.

Justine is a quadrangular love story involving its Irish narrator who is an English teacher in Alexandria, Mellisa- a tubercular cafe dancer and the narrator&#39;s mistress, Nessim- a very rich Alexandrian, and Justine- his wife- who is looking for some absolutes in life through a variety of sexual experiences and who, though she loves her husband, has an intense affair with the narrator. And- as important as any of the lovers - the city of Alexandria itself where the warring forces of mind, body and spirit in the individuals are reflected on a much larger screen. Sex is the key to this complex novel- but in spite of its plot (quite a suspenseful one) its style is poetic, overwhelmingly though not stuffily learned, allusive and intellectual. Its structure follows no chronological or conventional order. Instead the narrator tells his story with particularly clear and brilliant moments, people, feelings, scenes that he remembers and through diaries, journals and a novel by Justine&#39;s first husband. The whole thing builds into a mosaic of beauty and a mood picture of considerable power.</p><p><b>Lawrence Durrell </b>was born in 1912 in India. He attended the Jesuit College at Darjeeling and St. Edmund's School, Canterbury. His first literary work, <i>The Black Book</i>, appeared in Paris in 1938. His first collection of poems, <i>A Private Country</i>, was published in 1943, followed by the three Island books: <i>Prospero's Cell</i>; <i>Reflections on a Marine Venus</i>, about Rhodes; and <i>Bitter Lemons</i>, his account of life in Cyprus. Durrell's wartime sojourn in Egypt led to his masterpiece, <i>The Alexandria Quartet</i>, which he completed in southern France, where he settled permanently in 1957. Between the quartet and <i>The Avignon Quintet</i> he wrote the two-decker <i>Tunc </i>and <i>Nunquam</i>. His oeuvre includes plays, a book of criticism, translations, travel writing, and humorous stories about the diplomatic corps. <i>Caesar's Vast Ghost</i>, his reflections on the history and culture of Provence, including a late flowering of poems, was published a few days before his death in Sommi�res in 1990.<br><br><b>Robert Ryan</b>&nbsp;has written and illustrated several books including: <i>Justine</i>, <i>This Is For You</i>, and <i>A Sky Full Of Kindness</i>.

He lives and works in London.[Editor's Note: The following is a combined review with BALTHAZAR, MOUNTOLIVE, and CLEA.]--The four linked novels that comprise English author Lawrence Durrell's masterpiece, THE ALEXANDRIA QUARTET, are set in Alexandria, Egypt, around the time of WWII. The four novels explore the city's polyglot society, full of intrigue, mystery, and sensuality, telling essentially the same story from different points of view. JUSTINE focuses on the beautiful Jewish wife of a wealthy Copt. Her story is told by Darley, her English lover. In BALTHAZAR, Darley reconsiders and retells the story he told in Justine, using information from a mysterious new character, Balthazar. In MOUNTOLIVE, as war begins to loom, British Ambassador David Mountolive enters the intrigues of the interwoven community of characters. In CLEA, Darley returns to a war-fevered Alexandria as the stories of the many characters move toward conclusion. Narrator Nigel Anthony provides a brilliant reading, keeping the variety of voices--English, French, Egyptian--distinct throughout. He offers a one-man play, conveying the passions, disappointments, and triumphs of the complex cast. The classical music interludes that delineate sections of this beautifully produced and packaged set help transport the listener to back- streets of Alexandria. R.E.K.

That wasn&#x2019;t why he ran, however. Quite simply, he entered politics because he wanted to make a difference&#x2014;to contribute to the future of his children, his community, and his country.<br> <br>This memoir, while filled with delightful family anecdotes and Ellison&#x2019;s personal recollections, is far more than that. Ellison speaks from the heart, talking about the ever-changing face of America: his &#x201c;sweet land of liberty.&#x201d;<br> <br>In his own family, he sees an illustration of what makes America great. In three generations, his father&#x2019;s family went from slavery to respected professionals. And while being black is a source of pride for the family, they also acknowledge being a &#x201c;melting pot&#x201d;: Ellison ancestors include a white French-Creole merchant and his African-born slave mistress, a Spaniard, and even a Croatian. And he sees in them freedom of religion and expression. The Ellisons have room to love and respect not just a Muslim but also a Baptist, a couple of Catholics, and even an agnostic.<br> <br>Ellison talks candidly of himself and his dreams, his conversion to Islam, and how important his faith is to him. He is proud of his political role in pursuing justice for Muslim Americans whose constitutional rights are being imperiled by bigotry and ignorance. He dreams of his daughter growing into an independent, all- American woman who is also Muslim. But he emphasizes how his private beliefs play no part in his politics, because upholding the separation of church and state is fundamental to who he is.<br> <br>His frank commentary on all that America has the potential to be doesn&#x2019;t pull any punches, because Ellison believes true liberty grows and evolves. Just as our young nation slowly came to realize that we could achieve true liberty only when all people&#x2014;including the black ones&#x2014;were free, so we must now acknowledge as equals our new and changing population, no matter their color, country of origin, or creed. Ellison sees a country increasingly polarized by politics and religion, and like Martin Luther King Jr., he has a dream. A true United States of America&#x2014;undivided by petty hatred and bigotry and kept strong by unity. That&#x2019;s Keith Ellison&#x2019;s dream.</p><p><b>Keith Ellison</b> is a member of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.

Story of Huckleberry Finn. Classic Novel by Mark Twain.</p><p>A seminal work of American Literature that still commands deep praise and still elicits controversy, <i>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i> is essential to the understanding of the American soul. The recent discovery of the first half of Twain's manuscript, long thought lost, made front-page news. And this unprecedented edition, which contains for the first time omitted episodes and other variations present in the first half of the handwritten manuscript, as well as facsimile reproductions of thirty manuscript pages, is indispensable to a full understanding of the novel. The changes, deletions, and additions made in the first half of the manuscript indicate that Mark Twain frequently checked his impulse to write an even darker, more confrontational book than the one he finally published.Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms.

Since the age of fifteen she had drifted from one job, one town, to another. She could not have imagined she would find a perfect niche for herself in that senior residence, or that over the next three years she would come to be as happy as in her childhood, before fate took a hand. Founded in the mid-twentieth century to offer shelter with dignity to elderly persons of slender means, for some unknown reason from the beginning it had attracted left-wing intellectuals, oddballs, and second-rate artists. Lark House had undergone many changes over the years but still charged fees in line with each resident&#x2019;s income, the idea being to create a certain economic and racial diversity. In practice, all the residents were white and middle class, and the only diversity was between freethinkers, spiritual searchers, social and ecological activists, nihilists, and some of the few hippies still alive in the San Francisco Bay Area.<br> <br>At Irina&#x2019;s first interview, the director of the community, Hans Voigt, pointed out that she was too young for a job with such responsibility, but since they had a vacancy they needed to fill urgently, she could stay until they found someone more suitable. Irina thought the same could be said of him: he looked like a chubby little boy going prematurely bald, someone who was out of his depth running an establishment of this sort. As time went by, she realized that the initial impression of Voigt could be deceiving, at a certain distance and in poor light: in fact, he was fifty-four years old and had proved himself to be an excellent administrator. Irina assured him that her lack of qualifications was more than compensated for by the experience she had of dealing with old people in her native Moldova.<br> <br>Her shy smile softened the director&#x2019;s heart. He forgot to ask her for a reference and instead began outlining her duties, which could be quickly summarized: to make life easier for the second- and third-level residents. Irina would not be working with anyone on the first level, because they lived independently as tenants in an apartment building. Nor would she be working with those on level four&#x2014;the aptly named Paradise&#x2014;because they were awaiting their transfer to heaven and spent most of the time dozing, and thus did not require the kind of assistance she was there to provide. Irina&#x2019;s duties were to accompany the residents on their visits to doctors, lawyers, and accountants; to help them with their medical and tax forms; to take them on shopping expeditions; and to perform various other tasks. Her only link with the clients in Paradise, Voigt told her, would be to plan their funerals, but for that she would receive specific instructions, because the wishes of the dying did not always coincide with those of their families. Lark House residents tended to have myriad religious beliefs, which made their funerals rather complicated ecumenical affairs.<br> <br>Voigt explained that only the domestic staff, the care and health assistants, were obliged to wear a uniform. There was however a tacit dress code for the rest of the employees; respect and good taste were the order of the day when it came to clothes. For example, he said emphatically, the T-shirt printed with Malcolm X&#x2019;s face that Irina was wearing was definitely inappropriate. In fact it wasn&#x2019;t Malcolm X but Che Guevara, but Irina didn&#x2019;t tell him this because she assumed that Hans Voigt would never have heard of the guerrilla leader who fifty years after his heroic exploits was still worshipped in Cuba and by a handful of radical followers in Berkeley, where she was living. The T-shirt had cost two dollars in a used clothing store, and was almost new.<br> <br>&#x201c;No smoking on the premises,&#x201d; the director warned her.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t smoke or drink, sir.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Is your health good? That&#x2019;s important when you&#x2019;re dealing with old people.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Anything special I ought to know about you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m addicted to fantasy videos and novels. You know, like Tolkien, Neil Gaiman, Philip Pullman.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What you do in your free time is your business, young lady, just as long as you stay focused at work.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course. Listen, sir, if you give me a chance you&#x2019;ll see I know how to get along with elderly people. You won&#x2019;t regret it,&#x201d; the young woman said with feigned self-assurance.<br> <br>Once the formal interview in his office was concluded, Voigt showed her around the premises, which housed some two hundred and fifty people, with an average age of eighty-five. Lark House had once been the magnificent property of a chocolate magnate, who not only bequeathed it to the city but left a generous donation to finance its upkeep. It consisted of the main house, a pretentious mansion where the offices, communal areas, library, dining room, and workshops were situated, and a row of pleasant redwood tile buildings that fitted in well with the ten acres of grounds, which looked wild but were in fact carefully tended by a host of gardeners. The independent apartments and the buildings housing the second- and third-level residents were linked by wide, enclosed walkways, which allowed wheelchairs to circulate sheltered from the extremes of climate, but were glassed in on both sides to provide a view of nature, the best solace for the troubles of all ages. Paradise, a detached concrete building, would have looked out of place were it not for the fact it was completely overgrown with ivy. The library and games room were open day and night, the beauty salon kept flexible hours, and the workshops provided a variety of classes from painting to astrology for those who still longed for pleasant surprises in their future. The Shop of Forgotten Objects, staffed by volunteer ladies, offered for sale clothing, furniture, jewelry, and other treasures cast off by the residents, or left behind by the deceased.<br> <br>&#x201c;We have an excellent cinema club and show films three times a week in the library,&#x201d; Voigt told her.<br> <br>&#x201c;What kind of films?&#x201d; asked Irina, hoping they might contain vampires or science fiction.<br> <br>&#x201c;A committee chooses them, and they prefer crime movies, especially Tarantino. There&#x2019;s a certain fascination with violence in here, but don&#x2019;t worry, they&#x2019;re well aware it&#x2019;s fiction and that the actors will reappear safe and sound in other films. Let&#x2019;s call it a safety valve. Several of our guests fantasize about killing somebody, usually a family member.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Me too,&#x201d; said Irina without hesitation.<br> <br>Thinking she must be joking, Voigt laughed indulgently. He appreciated a sense of humor almost as much as he did patience among his staff.<br> <br>Squirrels and an unusually large number of deer roamed freely among the ancient trees of the grounds, Voigt explained, adding that the does gave birth to and raised their young until they could fend for themselves. The grounds also served as a bird sanctuary, above all for skylarks, whose presence there had given the facility its name: Lark House. There were several cameras strategically placed to monitor the animals in their habitat and also any residents who might wander off or suffer an accident, but Lark House had no strict security measures. By day the main gates remained open, with only a couple of unarmed guards patrolling the grounds. These two retired policemen, aged seventy and seventy-four, offered more than adequate protection, since no thief in his right mind would waste time on penniless old folks.<br> <br>Voigt and Irina passed a pair of women in wheelchairs, a group carrying easels and paint boxes to an open-air art class, and several residents out exercising dogs as careworn as them. The property adjoined the bay, and when the tide came in it was possible to go kayaking, which some of the residents not yet disabled by their infirmities were happy to do. This is how I would like to live, thought Irina, taking deep breaths of the sweet aroma of pines and laurels. She couldn&#x2019;t help comparing these pleasant surroundings to the sordid dives she had drifted through since the age of fifteen.<br> <br>&#x201c;Last but not least, Miss Bazili, I should mention the two ghosts, because I&#x2019;m sure that will be the first thing our Haitian staff will tell you about.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe in ghosts, Mr. Voigt.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Congratulations. Neither do I. The ones in Lark House are a young woman wearing a pink gauze dress, and a three-year-old child. The woman is Emily, the chocolate magnate&#x2019;s daughter. Poor Emily died of grief after her son drowned in the pool at the end of the 1940s. It was then that the magnate abandoned the house and created the Lark House Foundation.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Did the boy drown in the pool you showed me?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, but no one else has died there that I know of.&#x201d;<br> <br>Irina soon changed her mind about ghosts, realizing that Emily and her son weren&#x2019;t the only resident spirits. She was to discover that many of the old folk were permanently accompanied by their dead.<br> <br>Early the next morning, Irina arrived at work in her best pair of jeans and a discreet T-shirt. She quickly confirmed that the atmosphere at Lark House was relaxed without being negligent. It was more like a college than an old people&#x2019;s home. The food was as good as that of any reasonable Californian restaurant, and organic as far as possible. The cleaning staff did a thorough job, and the health aides and nurses were as cheerful as could be expected under the circumstances. It took her only a few days to learn the names and quirks of her colleagues and the residents in her care. The handful of Spanish and French phrases she memorized helped win over the staff, who came almost exclusively from Mexico, Guatemala, and Haiti. Although what they earned did not correspond to the hard work they put in, very few of them went around with long faces.<br> <br>&#x201c;You have to spoil the grannies a bit, but always treat them with respect. The same goes for the grandpas, but you need to watch out for them, because some of them get up to mischief,&#x201d; she was told by Lupita Farias, a stocky woman with the features of an Olmec statue who was head of the cleaning staff. Having worked at Lark House for thirty-two years and having access to every room, Lupita knew all the inhabitants intimately. She had learned about their lives, could see at a glance what was wrong with them, and accompanied them in their sorrows.<br> <br>&#x201c;Watch out for depression, Irina. That&#x2019;s very common here. If you notice that somebody seems isolated or very sad, if they stay in bed or stop eating, come and find me right away, okay?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you do in those cases, Lupita?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It depends. I stroke them, and they always like that, because old people don&#x2019;t have anyone who touches them, and I get them hooked on a TV series, because nobody wants to die before the final episode. Some of them find comfort in prayer, but there are lots of atheists here, and they don&#x2019;t pray. What&#x2019;s most important is not to leave them on their own. If I&#x2019;m not around, go and see Cathy. She knows what to do.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dr. Catherine Hope, a second-level resident, had been the first person to welcome Irina on behalf of the community. At sixty-eight, she was the youngest resident. Ever since being confined to a wheelchair she had opted for the help and company that Lark House offered. She had been living there a couple of years and during that time had become the life and soul of the place.<br> <br>&#x201c;The elderly are the most entertaining people in the world,&#x201d; she eventually told Irina. &#x201c;They have lived a lot, say whatever they like, and couldn&#x2019;t care less about other people&#x2019;s opinion. You&#x2019;ll never get bored here. Our residents are well educated, and if they&#x2019;re in good health they keep on learning and experimenting. This community stimulates them and they can avoid the worst scourge of old age: loneliness.&#x201d;<br> <br>Irina knew from newspaper reports about the progressive spirit of the Lark House residents. There was a waiting list of several years for admission, which would have been much longer if many of the candidates had not passed away before it was their turn. The old folks in the home were conclusive proof that age, despite all its limitations, does not stop one from having fun and taking part in the hubbub of life. Several of the residents who were active members of Seniors for Peace spent their Friday mornings in street protests at the aberrations and injustices in the world, especially those committed by the American empire, for which they felt responsible. These activists, among whom was an old lady aged a hundred and one, met up in the northern corner of the square opposite the police station with their canes, walkers, and wheelchairs. They held up banners against war or global warming, while the public showed their support by honking their car horns or signing petitions that these furious elders stuck under their noses. The protesters had appeared on television on more than one occasion, while the police were made to look ridiculous as they tried to disperse them with threats of tear gas that never materialized. Clearly moved, Voigt had shown Irina a plaque in the park in honor of a ninety-six-year-old musician, who had died of a seizure with his boots on in broad daylight during a 2006 protest against the war in Iraq.<br> <br>Irina had grown up in a Moldovan village that was inhabited only by old people and children. She thought of her own grandparents and, as so often in recent years, regretted having abandoned them. Lark House gave her the opportunity to give to others what she hadn&#x2019;t been able to give them, and she kept this in mind as she began looking after those in her care. She soon won the residents over, including several on the first level, the independent ones.<br> <br>From the start, Alma Belasco had caught her attention. She stood out from the other women thanks not only to her aristocratic bearing but to the magnetic force field that seemed to separate her from the rest of humanity. Lupita insisted that the Belasco woman did not fit in at Lark House and would not last long: any day now the same chauffeur who had brought her in a Mercedes-Benz would come and take her away again. And yet the months went by and this didn&#x2019;t happen. Irina did no more than observe Alma Belasco from a distance, because Hans Voigt had instructed her to focus on people from the second and third levels, and not to get distracted by the independents. Besides, Irina had more than enough to do in looking after her own clients&#x2014;they were not to be called patients&#x2014;and learning the ins and outs of her new job. As part of her training, she had to study the videos of recent funerals: a Buddhist Jewish woman and a repentant agnostic. For her part, Alma Belasco would not have paid any attention to Irina if circumstances had not briefly turned the young woman into the most noteworthy member of the community.</p><h2>Eating Well Through Cancer: Easy Recipes &amp; Recommendations During &amp; After Treatment</h2><p>For 15 years, Dr. Miletello, an oncologist, wanted to write a cookbook as one of the most frequently asked questions was, "What should I eat?"

Many of the works discussed are demanding, the likes of Augustine's <i>City of God</i>, Edmund Burke's <i>Reflections on the Revolution in France</i>, and Richard M. Weaver's <i>Ideas Have Consequences</i>--hardly books that Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly, or David Brock might curl up with. But as Williamson elucidates in the introduction, these books reflect conservatism, not the neoconservatism of current Republicans. And what is conservatism? "Man's willingness to discern for himself, and to accept from God, a fundamental, practical, just, human, and unchangeable plan for man--and to stick with it," Williamson says, later distinguishing two branches of conservatism, one "founded on eternal principles" and one "that appeals to historical context and the status quo, prudence, and pragmatism." Williamson presents 50 selected books in declension of categories, beginning with theology and ending with contemporary affairs. Book number 1 is the Bible; book 50 is <i>Treason</i>, by Anne Coulter, despite her support of the Bush administration. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

His masterpiece in the field of spiritual literature was "The Introduction to the Devout Life." Revolutionary in its day and noted for its charm, warmth, and clarity of language, it set forth a spirituality oriented toward life in the world, an approach quite different from that of St. Francis de Sales's contemporaries,who saw spiritual perfection as possible only in religious life.While the message of "The Introduction to Devout Life" is still valid today, the fact is that its expression is quite dated. In this book, as in "Bringing 'The Imitation of Christ' Into the 21st Cemtury," Father Meninger is not offering a new translation or paraphrase of a spiritual classic. Rather, he is attempting to express the teachings of the original in a wholly contemporary idiom. Father Meninger has not hesitated to change, omit, or add to the original where necessary, the better to highlight the heart and charisma of St. Francis de Sales's teachings.</p></p><p>William A. Meninger, O.C.S.O., is a monk of St. Benedict&#39;s Monastery in Snowmass, Colorado."Meninger captures the essential meaning?but the description is thoroughly modern. Fr. Meninger's rewrite of the ten meditations will be especially helpful to those teaching discursive meditation....[Meninger] demonstrates creative freedom ...in writing this book....But when he comes to material that still rings true today...Meninger stays very close to his source. Many of Meninger's updates are welcomed. All the erroneous science is gone...The spiritual vocabulary is more readable...materials is freshly presented. The Committed Life provides the Salesian world with a unique introduction to Salesian thought. This book should appeal especially to those who, up until now, have found the 17th century language of the Introduction difficult to digest....Meninger offers a fresh and modern perspective on St. Francis' great Christian classic and a teaching tool that should be reviewed by all involved in Salesian education."&#x2014;Bondings, March/April 2001<br><br>"Many fine sections on friendship."<br>-The Living Church, May 13, 2001<br><br>"Meninger offers a fresh perspective on St. Francis' great Christian classic and a teaching tool that should be reviewed by all involved in Salesian education."&#x2014;Bondings, A Newsletter of the Oblates of St. Francis de Sales<br><br>"When the Trappist monk William Meninger decided to adapt St. Francis de Sale's spiritual masterpiece, he did so with some trepidation&#x2014;and rightly so. The classic Introduction to the Devout Life is hailed not only for its wisdom, but also for the gentle charm of the writing itself. Meninger's wariness served him well, however, for though this edition makes use of 21-century insight and idiom, the heart and tone of the 17th century original is carefully preserved and warmly conveyed. [...] The Committed Life is best approached a little bit at a time, which seems especially fitting. Like the virtuous life it promises, this book calls for patience and a willingness to practice. As in the virtuous life, the rewards handsomely make up for the effort."<br>&#x2014;Catholic Digest, December 2001<br></p><h2>Father of the Man: A Novel</h2><p>A stunning literary debut: a powerful love story informed by ghostly <br>demarcations between World War II and the Vietnam War.<br><br>It's just after dawn, June 6, 1982: "Dutch" Potter, an upstate New York bus <br>driver and father of a soldier who's been missing in action in Vietnam for twelve <br>years, snaps and dons his World War II army uniform, collects passengers aboard his BC Transit bus, then veers off route, careening into the woods of northern Pennsylvania, where he holds seven hostages to his one demand: return my son.<br><br>This wild ride, taking us from New York to Normandy to Southeast Asia by way of Dutch's memories, hopes, and despair, is rendered in mesmerizingly lyrical prose-ranging in tone from bardic to barfly-and forms a brilliantly layered and nuanced narrative. As FBI helicopters whir and command centers are jerry-built, Dutch readies himself for an armed confrontation with federalauthorities, while his family and close-knit community are thrown into sudden and dramatic action. Father of the Man reveals itself to be a love story: not only between father and son, but between husband and wife, mother and child, the living and the dead.<br><br>Dutch Potter takes us, along with his hapless passengers, beyond the safe, the ordinary, to a heart of darkness.</p><p>Robert Mooney was born in Rochester, New York, and educated at Boston College and Binghamton University. He currently teaches literature and writing at Washington College, where he is the director of the O&#39;Neill Literary House. His short fiction has appeared in many journals and magazines. He and his wife, Maureen, and their two children divide their time between Chestertown, Maryland, and Binghamton, New York.Prologue<br><br>George Conklin had been the kind of kid who ate baby toads whole for nickels on Catholic school playgrounds, and he didn't change much when he got to adulthood, where all antes are raised. He was the guy who put itching powder in your T-shirt, wintergreen in your jockstrap, garter snakes in your kip. A real pain in the ass. He loved to gamble and had a bad case of what he called Luck o' the Irish, but we knew he cheated. He bet the farm nearly every time and died with enough happy cabbage in his pockets to feed the First Army. Who could mess with him? He threw out punches like he threw down beers, and even though he only came up to my shoulder standing at attention, what he had was enough. It was a body he treated like a jalopy he didn't care what happened to so long as it got him where he wanted to go. It'd been torn up from altercations in South Boston taverns-scars, welts, badly set bone-breaks, the whole nine yards. Most of his knuckles were jammed swollen for good. His nose had been flattened and his front tooth chipped in a way that made him look fifteen years older than he was.<br><br>If he'd been stupid we might have liked him right away, but there was a mind in there that rankled us-and I don't mean the prickly smarts of the bookworm, though he'd memorized a lot of Irish poetry and had the vocabulary of an archbishop, if he needed it. It was the screwy moral code he lived by. Take our favorite subject. You could be really vile, like he was, with high-society British quiffs, but couldn't bad-mouth a prostitute. It was OK to say "cunt" in front of him, but not "vagina." He'd show a wallet photo of his wife like it was a holy card, but he went out on skirt patrol pretty regular while we were stationed at Stover. Just couldn't resist the light chassis. What made it tough socializing with him was that nobody told a better dirty joke, and he had a line of limericks from Dover to Bristol. But somebody joining in always ended up violating one of his personal Commandments and got the shit beat out of him if he wouldn't back down.<br><br>We figured it had something to do with religion, but who knew? He hated authority but loved God without question. He'd take communion after bothering the padre with confession, then go out after Mass and paint a penis with a face sniffing buttocks on the outside wall of the officers' club. Stuff like that. If you covered for him he'd get sore. There was just no reading the guy except finding out the hard way and trying to make heads and tails of it.<br><br>After a month of maneuvers in England we'd all had it up to here with him. Stewart owed him two weeks' pay on a poker game he said wasn't on the up-and-up. Goddamn Rokos, who'd won some middleweight title in Philly, had his face rearranged for no reason at all, and Rizzo's wrist hung in a sling for two weeks for asking Conklin how he did it with his wife. Klein was pissed at his own fear of him. Me? I thought the cocky little bastard needed to be taken down a few pegs.<br><br>It was through this scapular I really got to know him. He used to wear it around his neck with his dog tag and sometimes we'd catch him talking to it. Not crazy kind of talk-the man at least had pretty good control over himself that way. Just a whisper here and there, holding it up to his lips like you'd nibble on the collar of your T-shirt. You'd only catch him if you were real close, at a shoulder-to-shoulder crapshoot, say, or if you had the bottom bunk next to his, like I did. We knew enough to keep our mouths shut; it was just another Conklin thing. I'd always associated these scapulars with Catholic women. On my honeymoon just a few months before, I found one in the cup of my wife's bra, but I was too shy to ask questions. And I liked the mystery of this ribbony thing rubbing against her nipple all day long, like some sort of ecclesiastical lingerie.<br><br>Conklin would take his off only when he went to the showers. He'd place the squares of cloth together like a card shark lining up a pair of aces, loop the brown ribbon around them, and tuck it all under the folded dress uniform in his footlocker. When he returned, the first thing he did was dig the scapular out and put it back on.<br><br>One afternoon after maneuvers we were sitting around the barracks fucking the dog. We'd started practicing for the invasion with live ammunition and were a little on edge. Mail was in, and a group of us sat on our bunks reading letters out loud. I had one from Sarah tucked away in my front right pocket. Rizzo had a letter from his brother in the Pacific theater who planned to give Hirohito a taste from his hip flask, and Rizzo took up right away on how he was going to settle things on this end-you know, march right into the F�hrer's bunker and slice off Hitler's balls with the hunting knife the old man gave him for the job. Conklin laughed like a flock of geese and said Rizzo couldn't beat his own wop grandmother at arm wrestling.<br><br>"Fuck you," Rizzo told him.<br><br>"What are you going to do, Rizzo, cut my balls off?"<br><br>"If I could ever find them."<br><br>"Oh, well, see balls," Conklin explained, "sometimes referred to as nuts, gonads, stones, rocks, cods, cullions, bollocks, family jewels, or-for the learned among us-testicles or testes, manufacture and store spermatozoa used during the reproductive process-what you call 'fucking'-to fertilize the female ovum. They're located in a sac at the crotch of the normal male. Here, I'll show you."<br><br>Conklin had been standing beside his bunk undressing to take a shower, and he pushed his briefs down to his knees.<br><br>"Most everyone in this room has a pair," he said, jiggling his in his hand. "If you don't believe me, ask around."<br><br>Rizzo's face burned red. "Asshole," he said.<br><br>"No," said Conklin, "that's over this way."<br><br>He turned and mooned the group of us, finished undressing, took a towel, and headed for the shower. When they could hear the water running Rokos said, "Goddamn Conklin."<br><br>"Smartass," said Lopez.<br><br>"Thinks he's hot shit," said Stewart.<br><br>Weaver, the peacemaker of the group, said he was just bustin', and we knew that was true too, but Rizzo was sort of a man's man-a braggart, sure, but the fiction did no harm. He sat there fuming while the boys shouted down Weaver and I went over to Conklin's footlocker, opened it, felt around for a minute, and held up the scapular for the boys' inspection.<br><br>"He'll goddamn shit his pants, man," said Rokos.<br><br>"Then beat the shit out of the guy who took it," said Klein.<br><br>"What's he going to do?" I said, stuffing the thing in the pocket of my fatigues. "Beat up the whole platoon?"<br><br>One by one they nodded. Rizzo saw everyone else smiling, and he showed his yellow horse teeth and nodded with them. We waited, and when Conklin strutted back into the room singing his war song, his towel around him like a kilt, he joined the silence for a moment before saying, "Remember, Riz: the balls are located at the intersection of the thighs of the male."<br><br>He turned to dress, and the boys elbowed one another while he foraged through his footlocker. He patted his hand over his collarbone and stood with his arms at his sides.<br><br>"Something wrong, Mr. Balls?" Rizzo said.<br><br>Conklin looked back at us with his top lip moving like shivering Liz.<br><br>"Yeah," Stewart piped in. "Lose your rubbers or something?"<br><br>Rokos snorted like a stallion and Conklin turned and aimed himself at Weaver, a scrawny kid from Rhode Island, weakest guy in the platoon, last in everything, a bit lacy-if you know what I mean. We called him Wimpy, but we liked him so far.<br><br>"Hand it over," Conklin said, and Wimp said, "Me?" and started to say something else, but Conklin was already grinding his forehead into Wimp's and twisting the poor bastard's wrist behind his back. Stewart told him to back off and Rokos said yeah, back off, but no one moved. Conklin knew about pressure points; one touch in the right place and he could bring Goliath himself to his knees. He got Weaver just behind his neck and Weaver's legs gave out, but Conklin wouldn't let him fall. I dug into my pocket and held the scapular out like a ticket to the fair. He let go of Weaver and snapped his fingers and I laid the thing over his open hand with Wimp gasping like a radiator on the floor between us. He put it on without taking his eyes off me, returned to his footlocker, and got dressed. He took his time. When he finished lacing up his groundhogs, he turned and said, "Potter, outside." I looked at the boys looking at me and followed Conklin out of the barracks.<br><br>My fatigues hadn't dried from maneuvers so the rain didn't much matter to me, but by the time we reached the end of the long row of Quonsets and were heading along the road into town, Conklin was drenched again. His shoulders were hunched and he looked like he was about to dive on a loose football. All the way into town and he didn't so much as look over his shoulder at me.<br><br>Paignton was a seaside village of the type you see in paintings except the preparation for war intruded everywhere you looked. Half the people were in uniform. Planes tore up the sky. There were billboards that said things like "Be like Dad, keep Mum," and just like a poem gathering in my head a boy stepped out of a doorway and said, "Got any gum, chum?" We walked right past him, but then Conklin stopped so suddenly that we nearly collided. He dug into his trousers pocket, pulled out a pack of Juicy Fruit, and tossed the whole thing. The kid bent down to pick it up and yelled "Bloody 'ell, chum!" but putting on the humanitarian thing wasn't going to take the white out of my knuckles.<br><br>Down on the beach waves grabbed at the land as if water itself could drown. The wet sand was loose under my feet and we kept going until Conklin hefted himse...</p><h2>The Sons of Caesar: Imperial Rome&#39;s First Dynasty</h2><p><p><strong>The story of one of the most colorful dynasties in history, from Caesar's rise to power in the first century BC to Nero's death in AD 68</strong></p> This engaging new study reviews the long history of the Julian and Claudian families in the Roman Republic and the social and political background of Rome. At the heart of the account are the lives of six men&#x2015;Julius Caesar, Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Neromen&#x2015;who mastered Rome and then changed it from a democracy to a personal possession. It was no easy task: Caesar and Caligula were assassinated, Nero committed suicide, and Claudius was poisoned. Only Augustus and Tiberius died natural deaths and even that is uncertain.<br><br> The Julio-Claudian saga has a host of other intriguing characters, from Cicero, the last great statesman of the Republic, to Livia, matriarch of the Empire; the passionate Mark Antony and the scheming Sejanus; and Agrippina, mother of Nero and sister of Caligula, who probably murdered her husband and was in turn killed by her son. Set against a background of foreign wars and domestic intrigue, the story of Rome's greatest dynasty is also the story of the birth of an imperial system that shaped the Europe of today. 90 Illustrations</p><p>Philip Matyszak has a doctorate in Roman history from St. John&#x2019;s College, Oxford, and is the author of numerous books, including the bestselling The Greek and Roman Myths: A Guide to the Classical Stories, as well as Legionary: The Roman Soldier&#x2019;s (Unofficial) Manual and Ancient Rome on 5 Denarii a Day.When Rome became a republic in 509 BC, its citizens so deplored the idea of monarchy they would not even allow a foreign king into the city. Despite such thinking, the Republic's institutions were vulnerable to the power, money and influence of its aristocracy. Matyszak's book is an engrossing and expertly assembled presentation of Rome's first families, the Julio-Claudian line of leaders whose example, Matyszak argues, "continues to convince many that an effective autocracy is superior to a dysfunctional democracy." Two of Matyszak's main reasons for re-examining this oft-explored era are to overturn common myths, including the widely-accepted, "facile" explanation for Rome's downfall-strain caused by expansion and military campaigns-and to prove that empire is not always a dirty word. Matyszak follows the slow transformation of a republican government into an expansive imperial power, beginning with the awkward reconciliation between Julius Caesar's declaration of dictatorship and the existing Roman constitution, and continuing in small but significant steps amid civil wars and familial infighting. His profiles, from Julius to Nero, are fresh looks at characters marred by caricature and misconception, and his analysis of Rome's transformation is both instructive and precient, and will give those who employ the term "empire" in contemporary public dialogue much to consider. 90 illustrations.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This text reconstructs the two expeditions they made into Mayan territory, with historical and architectural annotations, and Catherwood&#39;s illustrations for Stephens travel diaries.</p><p>Fabio Bourbon, who lives in Italy, specializes in writing and editing books about art and ancient civilizations.Part adventure story, part archaeological study, part travel sketchbook, this handsomely illustrated book chronicles the discoveries of respected London artist Frederick Catherwood. In 1839, Catherwood and his American companion, John Lloyd Stephens, were the first Westerners to view the "lost" Mayan cities of the Yucatan Peninsula. Stephens's lively travel diaries, superbly illustrated by Catherwood, were then published in 1841 and 1843. Based on these journals and extensive research, Bourbon (coauthor of Ancient Rome: History of a Civilization That Ruled the World) has pieced together Catherwood's fascinating biography. Illustrated with more than 200 engravings, taken from Catherwood's original drawings, this work also reproduces Catherwood's Views of Ancient Monuments in Central America, Chiapas and YucatanDa rare color portfolio considered to be his best work. Catherwood's other adventures are detailed, including his trips to Europe and Egypt, as well as what is known of his personal life. Very few books have been written about Catherwood, and this one is reasonably priced, especially for its quality and size. It will appeal to anyone interested in exploration, architecture, or archaeology and is recommended for larger public libraries, academic libraries, and specialized collections.DSylvia Andrews, Indiana State Lib., Indianapolis <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Warden (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>The book centers on the character of Mr. Harding, a clergyman of great personal integrity, whose charitable income far exceeds the purpose for which it was intended. Young John Bold turns his reforming zeal to exposing what he considers to be an abuse of privilege, despite being in love with Mr. Harding's daughter Eleanor. The novel was highly topical as a case regarding the misapplication of church funds was the scandalous subject of contemporary debate. But Trollope uses this specific case to explore and illuminate the universal complexities of human motivation and social morality. This edition includes an introduction and notes by David Skilton and illustrations by Edward Ardizzone.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

Some of Trollope's best-loved works revolve around the imaginary county of Barsetshire, but he also wrote penetrating novels on political, social, and gender issues and<br>conflicts of his day.</p><h2>J. M. W. Turner: Painting Set Free</h2><p>When the prolific British painter Joseph Mallord William Turner (1775&#x2013;1851) died at the age of 76, his contemporaries held a generally negative view of his recent work, describing it as indulgent, eccentric, and even repulsive. But over the past century, a number of curators and critics have reassessed Turner&#x2019;s late paintings. Instead of finding his employment of shimmering color to evoke light unpleasant or unskilled, they have seen it as a precursor to the Impressionists and consider his use of abstraction to be distinctly modern.<br> &nbsp;<br> In this elegantly conceived volume, leading experts on Turner consider these contrasting views of the artist in a groundbreaking exploration of his paintings. They examine his notes and sketchbooks to determine whether his health may have impacted his art and how Victorian views of old age influenced perceptions of the elderly artist. They also question the notion that Turner&#x2019;s late work articulated a conclusive, radical vision heedless of public reaction, for evidence makes clear that he had a firm idea of the art market in his day.<br> &nbsp;<br> Fully illustrated in color, this book is published on the occasion of an exhibition on view at the Tate Britain, London, from September 15, 2014, through January 18, 2015; at the J. Paul Getty Museum from February 24 through May 24, 2015; and at the de Young Museum in San Francisco from June 20 through September 20, 2015.</p><p>David Blayney Brown is Manton Curator of British Art, 1790&#x2013;1850, Tate Britain, where Amy Concannon is assistant curator of British Art, 1790&#x2013;1850.

In those days to write at all meant to write well.&#x201d; &#x2013; Georg Christoph Lichtenberg. I was originally born in Ohio.... Well, that's interesting, I thought, as I absentmindedly listened to the sports announcer on the radio. Wait! STOP! "I was ORIGINALLY BORN IN OHIO..."? Well, gosh. Where were you born after THAT? Then there are the baseball commentators who routinely say things like: "If he makes that play, the run may not have scored." Well, again, wait just a minute. "If he MAKES that play...." But the play is already over. Why is the sentence in the present tense? "...The run may not have scored." But it DID score, so in this case, the proper word is "might," "MIGHT not have scored." A baseball announcer with any feeling for elementary good grammar would have said: "If he had made that play, the run might not have scored." Oh, and then there are little niceties like this: "If I'm the Dallas Cowboys, I gotta believe...." But you AREN'T the Dallas Cowboys, and besides, how could one person be an entire football organization? Okay, okay, sports broadcasters are easy to pick on (though one wonders why sports announcers, who are paid to speak, can't speak clearly, grammatically, and well). The problem is -- and it's the problem squarely confronted in this book -- that such loose, breezy, and ungrammatical language is epidemic in print, too. Newspapers and magazines are full of clich�s and buzzwords, and there's not one writer in ten who understands that difference between "lay" and "lie." If you have a friend who goes duck hunting, and s/he gives you a bunch of down, you might want to LAY the down on your mattress. Similarly, you LAY turf in the yard, or LAY bricks in the patio. But when you take to your bed for a nap, you LIE down. (The issue is clarified in this book.) Language, whether spoken or written, is like a game, and like all games, it has rules. Now, "rules" does not have to be a scary word, and we all know that in language, the rules are constantly changing. "Ain't" was once a fairly common, and unremarkable, word, but nowadays, the President cannot use "ain't" in a State of the Union address; that's just the way the game is currently played. Furthermore, we judge language, whether spoken or written, by how well it accomplishes its ends within the agreed-upon rules. (On the subject of games without rules, Robert Frost said, apropos free verse: "I would as soon play tennis with the net down.") There are many rules, formal and informal, and many little distinctions, to be learned, in language, and the author considers it fun, rather than a chore, to learn them. What is the difference between "loath" and "loathe"? When do we use "who," and when do we use "whom"? What is a gerund, what is apposition? These, and many other niceties of language, are investigated and explained in this updating of William Strunk, Jr.'s classic work. The book is based on Strunk's original text of 1918, which he wrote for the use of his students at Cornell University; it proved to be a landmark. The book was revised and expanded by E.B. White, of New Yorker fame, in 1959, but it has had no significant update since 1979. And since that time, many little affronts (for some of us, insults) to the eye and ear have gotten into the language. So here is a new edition of Strunk's classic work, with many of his rules and pronouncements expanded and explained; with new sections on proper usage and correct spelling; and even a "Rogue's Gallery" comprised of samples of egregious writing culled from current newspapers and magazines. For anyone who will reflect on it, language is an ongoing, fascinating adventure. The author intends this book to make that adventure more rewarding, and more enjoyable. Oh. The difference between "dryer" and "drier"? That, like so much else, is in the book.</p><p>...earned a B.A. in philosophy from Haverford College, and on a Rockefeller Fellowship studied at the University of Chicago.

Edited and with an introduction and supplementary material by Tony Trigilio. Designed for both general readers and scholars, this book brings together for the first time all of the poems and fragments in Elise Cowen's surviving notebook, recovering the work of a postwar female poet whose reputation had been submerged for more than a half-century. Remembered dismissively as the woman who dated Allen Ginsberg for a brief time in the early 1950s, she wrote hundreds of poems, many in a lyric mode that recalls Sappho and many in a visionary mode that resembles Emily Dickinson. After her suicide in 1962, nearly all of her work was destroyed. One notebook survived, rescued by a close friend, and this notebook is the basis for ELISE COWEN: POEMS AND FRAGMENTS.<br> <br> "Elise Cowen, an artist long obscured by legend, myth, archival uncertainty and copyright dispute, relegated to rumor and sensation, has been recuperated by Tony Trigilio's groundbreaking collection of her poetry. Trigilio collects the primary material from the poet's recovered notebook and provides, in his indispensable Notes to the Poems, an impressive critical literary historical analysis. A modern Eumenide and proto-second-wave feminist of uncompromising voice, Cowen's searing verse poignantly claims female subjectivity. Thanks to Trigilio's inspired, erudite and meticulous recovery work, this collection will make a profound difference in the way Beat movement writing is reckoned and experienced."&#x2014;Ronna C. Johnson</p><p>Beat generation poet Elise Cowen was born in 1933 into a middle class Jewish family in Washington Heights, New York. While attending Barnard College she began a brief relationship with Allen Ginsberg, remaining close to him the rest of her life. From 1956 until 1962 she moved back and forth between California and New York, struggling with increasingly severe psychological breakdowns. She committed suicide in 1962 by jumping through a closed window at her parents house. After her death, the bulk of Cowen's writing was destroyed at the behest of her parents, who were uneasy with her representations of sexuality and drug use, but a handful of poems and fragments have survived and reached publication.<br>Tony Trigilio's recent books include the poetry collections THE COMPLETE DARK SHADOWS (OF MY CHILDHOOD) (BlazeVOX Books, 2014), WHITE NOISE (Apostrophe Books, 2013) and HISTORIC DIARY (BlazeVOX Books, 2010), and the critical monograph <em>Allen Ginsberg's Buddhist Poetics</em>, which was released in a new edition by Southern Illinois University Press in 2012.

His memory of that time devolves on the charismatic Grace family, particularly the seductive twins Myles and Chloe.

Many of the railroad stories in this theme anthology were tailored for popular magazines of the era by authors who used stock adventure plots and added significant doses of railroad lore, but the better stories in the collection strive for a more universal appeal. Thomas Wolfe's "The Near and the Far" is perhaps the best entry, a brief but poignant ode to the influence of perspective on the memories of a retired conductor who visits a tiny homestead that was once part of his daily route. A more pedestrian affair, O. Henry's "Holding Up a Train" is a straightforward primer on how pull off a train robbery. "Hoboes that Pass in the Night," by Jack London, reflects the writer's days of riding the rails. There is a brief chapter from The Octopus, Frank Norris's well-known railroad novel. Most of the remaining tales fall into the category of light comedy or adventure by such specialists as Harry Bedwell, Frank Hamilton Spearman and Cy Warman, among others. Written between 1897 and 1941, these tales collectively elicit nostalgia for a time when, helped by the railroads, America was just beginning to introduce itself to itself. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.All aboard for a magazine story form popular from the 1890s to the 1930s. It attracted big names like O. Henry and Jack London, but the less-renowned writers of the stories here were no slouches in creating entertaining yarns set on a moving train. Despite their common frame, their themes vary widely. A Thomas Wolfe story captures aging in a just-retired engineer's dismay at visiting a house he had often passed on his runs. Octavus Cohen constructs a clever tale of honesty lost and found in the perils of a Pullman porter; elsewhere in the collection, a comparable fixture on the railroads, the newsboy, cast in the Horatio Alger^-type mold, averts a terrible crash through his knowledge of telegraphy. Collisions between trains and encounters on them mark this compilation's motif, and whether applied seriously or to humorous effect, as in "Mrs. Union Station," concerning one man's fanatical interest in model trains, both students of short-story technique and nontechnocratic fans of tall tales of the rails will find enjoyable variety. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i></p><h2>Meditation: The Art of Ecstasy</h2><p>In this book, enlightened spiritual master Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh talks about meditation suggests a variety of meditation techniques that are particularly suitable for westerners.

Then the Contessa&#39;s cousin, Olimpia, is stabbed to death in a crime of passion. All clues twist back to the Contessa&#39;s relatives, but it is a delicate matter; especially as it is Barbara&#39;s loyal maid, Mina, who is found kneeling beside the body clutching a pair of bloodied scissors . . .</p><p>Edward Sklepowich has been an expatriate American for many years. He has been a Fullbright scholar of American literature in Egypt, Algeria, and Tunisia. He divides his time between Tunisia, where he is a university lecturer, Venice, New York, and a former Phoenician town on the Tunisian Mediterranean called Sousse. His deep feeling for Venice is one expression of his maternal Italian heritage.<br>In Sklepowich's well-paced ninth Venetian mystery (after 2008's Frail Barrier), literary biographer Urbino Macintyre, who's assisting his friend Contessa Barbara with an exhibit devoted to fabric designer Mariano Fortuny, visits the Palazzo Pindar, the home of Barbara's eccentric cousins. The palace houses a museum, including letters from Fortuny to the Pindars. Urbino turns sleuth after the contessa finds one of her cousins, Olimpia, dead at Palazzo Pindar with stab wounds in her chest. Kneeling next to the body is Mina, Barbara's personal maid, holding a bloody pair of scissors and crying, "I killed her! I killed her!" Convinced Mina is innocent, Urbino investigates all the members of the Pindar family, a goodly number of suspects, in an effort to unmask Olimpia's true killer. Sklepowich dramatically juxtaposes the splendor of Venice against the dark deed of murder. --Publishers Weekly, 13th July 2009<br><br>In this latest installment of the popular, Venice-set Urbino Macintyre series (following Frail Barrier, 2008), American expatriate Urbino and his dear friend Contessa Barbara da-Capo Zendrini agree to look into the matter of Barbara's strange cousins, the Pindars. Their concern is aroused when cousin Gaby, who hasn't left her palazzo in more than 20 years, tells the contessa's maid, Mina, that she is afraid someone might be attacked. Only a few days later, Gaby's older sister, Olimpia, is found dead with Mina kneeling at her side. Now the case is more than mere curiosity, as Urbino and the contessa must work to free Mina from jail, which requires delving deeply into the Pindars' troubled past. Is the murder somehow connected to the fact that the cousins recently agreed to loan several Fortuny textiles to an upcoming show of the famous designer's work? Sklepowich combines an agreeable cozy mystery with some atmospheric writing about Venice, evoked both in descriptive passages and in the characters' palpable love of the city. New and old readers will enjoy this charming entry, which should be suggested to all Donna Leon fans. --Booklist, 1st August 2009</p><h2>1914-1918 Voices and Images of the Great War: First Edition</h2><p>This book uses personal accounts and illustrations, mainly from the author&#39;s own archives, to cover all aspects of World War I-from departure of the Old Contemptibles to fight the Kaiser in 1914, young men eagerly enlisting, high hopes of 1915 that fizzled out at Gallipoli, to the bloody fields of Flanders. It runs through the battles of the Somme and Passchendaele to the coming of the Americans, fighting in the closing months of the war, joyous celebrations of Armistice Day and burial of the unknown warrior in the aftermath. The authors have drawn on the experiences of the men who fought, touching on subjects as diverse as propaganda, fear, morale, bravery, bawdiness, filth, and frivolity and the stark contrast between attitudes of civilians at home and the men at the front. Newspapers, magazines, letters, diaries, songs, poems, as well as a wealth of first-hand anecdotes and personal accounts by the soldiers themselves are included in this book.</p><p></p><h2>Boo Who (The Boo Series #2)</h2><p><i>&#x201c;Knock knock.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s there?&#x201d; <br></i><br>Nobody in Skary seems to know for sure...<br><br>It appears that everyone in Skary, Indiana, is having an identity crisis of epic proportions&#x2013;including the town itself.

Born in rural Indiana, she and her family moved to Southern California, where, still a child, she began studying dance with a visionary fanaticism that also grips her narrative. The book is sometimes very funny--George Balanchine makes an appearance as the Loch Ness monster in one of Tharp's dreams--but it is also earnest as Tharp describes her efforts to make her mark on the seminal modern dance scene of New York City in the 1960s. Tharp tells of her difficult marriage to painter Bob Huot and, elliptically, of their son; documents the life of her dance company; candidly confronts the failure of her production of Singin' in the Rain ; and considers most, though not all, of her dances. A few false notes include fulsome thanks paid to patrons and supporters and an overdetermined finale ("Finally I can feel that my attempts to discover truth through objective distance have linked up with my gut").

Chapters devoted to the creation of her stunning dances, "Deuce Coupe" and "Push Comes to Shove" are exhilarating. She depicts a life born of a fascinating mix of Quaker roots and an ambitious mother. Along with her sheer talent, Tharp's tough, gutsy determination enabled astonishing breakthroughs in dance but also masked a touchy insecurity that made her difficult to know. She relates startling anecdotes of unfair demands she made on friends and dancers, whose names read like a Who's Who of the art world. But such harsh self-disclosures make it apparent that she has learned from living. The book ends with a chronology of her work from 1965 to 1992.

These generic subjects and their representational conventions, however, have their own origins and early histories. In sixteenth-century Antwerp, painting and the emerging new medium of engraving began to depart from traditional visual culture, which had been defined primarily by wall paintings, altarpieces, and portraits of the elite. New genres and new media arose simultaneously in this volatile commercial and financial capital of Europe, home to the first open art market near the city Bourse. The new pictorial subjects emerged first as hybrid images, dominated by religious themes but also including elements that later became pictorial categories in their own right: landscapes, food markets, peasants at work and play, and still-life compositions. In addition to being the place of the origin and evolution of these genres, the Antwerp art market gave rise to the concept of artistic identity, in which favorite forms and favorite themes by an individual artist gained consumer recognition.</p><p>In <i>Peasant Scenes and Landscapes</i>, Larry Silver examines the emergence of pictorial kinds&#x2014;scenes of taverns and markets, landscapes and peasants&#x2014;and charts their evolution as genres from initial hybrids to more conventionalized artistic formulas. The relationship of these new genres and their favorite themes reflect a burgeoning urbanism and capitalism in Antwerp, and Silver analyzes how pictorial genres and the Antwerp marketplace fostered the development of what has come to be known as "signature" artistic style. By examining Bosch and Bruegel, together with their imitators, he focuses on pictorial innovation as well as the marketing of individual styles, attending particularly to the growing practice of artists signing their works. In addition, he argues that consumer interest in the style of individual artists reinforced another phenomenon of the later sixteenth century: art collecting. While today we take such typical artistic formulas as commonplace, along with their frequent use of identifying signatures (a Rothko, a Pollock), <i>Peasant Scenes and Landscapes</i> shows how these developed simultaneously in the commercial world of early modern Antwerp.</p></p><p>Larry Silver is Farquhar Professor of History of Art at the University of Pennsylvania. He is the author of many books, including Rembrandt and Art in History, and coeditor (with Jeffrey Chipps Smith) of The Essential Durer, also available from the University of Pennsylvania Press.<p>"Grandly conceived and richly rewarding. . . . By integrating current critical methodologies&#x2014;semiotics, rhetoric, economic theory&#x2014;into the examination of sixteenth-century painting in Antwerp, Silver's study has significant and far-reaching application and relevance to other disciplines, notably history and literary criticism."&#x2014;<i>Choice</i></p><br><br><p>Selected by <i>Choice</i> magazine as an Outstanding Academic Title for 2006</p><br><br><p>"Encompassing a complex and varied set of methodologies, economic histories of the arts have framed compelling new questions around the activities of artists, patrons, and dealers as cultural agents that tend to locate meaning in behavior rather than visuality.

A deadbeat father needed to be found, and Vanessa needed to do some field work, so she took the file and headed out to keep an eye on the last known address.<br><br>Jake got to work on something much more personal...and dangerous. The Castro had become the stomping ground, literally, of two violent gay-bashers and the most recent victim was Jake's son's lover. Father and son are estranged, but maybe helping now would help them reconcile. That was Jake's thought when he started. For Nameless it was all a matter of letting everyone know that if they needed his help, he was there.<br><br>Jake was handling his situation but for Vanessa, things got out of hand. Her perp never showed up, but when she saw a man carrying a young girl into the house across the street, she knew something was wrong....and about to get worse, because she was going to investigate what was going on. <br><br>When she doesn't show up a few days later, Nameless feels a sinking in his gut: a few years ago he'd been kidnapped, shackled, and left to die in a cabin in the woods and something about Vanessa's disappearance echoed too loudly. When he discovers the house she'd investigated on her own and sees the words TAKING US TO A HOUSE IN THE WOODS scrawled on a closet wall, the echo became thunderous. <br><br>Now it was a race against time, and the clock had begun ticking before "Nameless" and Jake heard the starter's gun. <br></p><p>Conceived as a lone-wolf sleuth, prowling the fog-embraced hills and criminal redoubts of modern San Francisco, Bill Pronzini's Nameless Detective has evolved over the course of 29 novels into a semi-retired family man and mentor to two younger operatives, neither of whom seems any more capable of staying out of trouble than Nameless was in his prime. Fortunately, <i>Nightcrawlers</i> (the sequel to <i>Spook</i>) packs enough grim drama and emotional traumas to go around.<p> A couple of short-fused homophobes are putting the hurt on gay men in the city's Castro district, and among their victims is Kenneth Hitchcock, the elder lover of investigator Jake Runyon's estranged 22-year-old son, Joshua. So, for professional as well as personal reasons, the widowed Runyon takes an interest in these attacks, connecting the bashers to an underage hustler and an "old-fashioned meat market" called the Dark Spot. Meanwhile, Nameless is summoned to the death bed of Russell Dancer, a manifestly repulsive former pulp-magazine contributor (first introduced in 1973's <i>Undercurrent</i>), now fallen on hard times, who has an unpublished manuscript he wants delivered to Nameless's mother-in-law, Cybil Wade, after whom he's lusted--unrequitedly--for half a century. It will be a test of Nameless's diplomatic acumen to fulfill Dancer's request, without drawing rancor from both Cybil and his wife, Kerry. A still greater test, however, awaits Nameless's black junior partner, Tamara Corbin, whose assignment to stake out a deadbeat dad turns into something more perilous, after she spots her subject's neighbor sneaking an unidentified, squirming bundle into his house one dark eve.</p><p> It's evidence of just how much American detective fiction has changed over the last 30 years, that <i>Nightcrawlers</i> can come off as fresh. Even with its high-stakes, triple plot lines, this novel is more retro than revolutionary. Yet the Shamus-winning Pronzini, who has outlasted most of his original contemporaries to become a sage of the genre, continues to entice by emphasizing character development over simplistic violence or gruesome gimmickry, and by allowing Nameless to do something rarely attempted: explore the creaky twilight of his hero-hood (he's now in his early 60s). Seems that age really <i>can</i> bring wisdom. --<i>J. Kingston Pierce</i></p>Bill Pronzini is the author of more than sixty novels. He created "Nameless" in a short story in 1969, and the first Nameless novel was published in 1971, making his exploits the longest-running private eye series currently being published.<br><br>Bill Pronzini has received three Shamus Awards (two for best novel, and the Lifetime Achievement Award), and six Edgar Award nominations.

One of Rembrandt&#x2019;s most talented students, Maes began by painting biblical scenes in the style of his famous teacher. He later produced extraordinary genre pieces, in which the closely observed actions of the main figure, often a woman, have a hushed, almost monumental character. Maes also depicted mothers with children or older women praying or sleeping; such works have placed him among the most popular painters of the Dutch Golden Age. From around 1660, Maes turned exclusively to portraiture, and his elegant style attracted wealthy and eminent clients from Dordrecht and Amsterdam. This generously illustrated volume is the first in English to cover the full range of his repertoire. The authors&#x2014;curators from the National Gallery, London, and the Mauritshuis, The Hague&#x2014;bring extensive knowledge to bear for the benefit of specialists and the general public.</p><p>This impressive catalogue offers the first English-language survey of works by Nicolaes Maes, a celebrated artist of the Dutch Golden Age and leading pupil of Rembrandt.<b>Bart Cornelis</b> is curator of Dutch and Flemish paintings at the National Gallery, London. <b>Ariane van Suchtelen</b> is curator at the Mauritshuis, The Hague.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Zombie-Loan, Vol. 2 (Zombie-Loan, 2)</h2><p>Three classmates who make their living (literally!) by acting as agents of the Z-Loan office and dispatching zombies - Chika Akatsuki, Shito Tachibana, and Michiru Kita - are hot on the trail of an elusive psychopath known as &#34;The Butterfly.&#34; But as if serial killers and zombies weren&#39;t enough to worry about, poor Michiru&#39;s barely had a chace to get used to her new digs, her new life, and...What&#39;s this?

Without a solid financial and spiritual foundation on which to base sound decisions, problems-and not just money problems-tend to multiply in a marriage. And they come whether you're struggling on $20,000 a year or "coasting" on a six-figure income.<br> <br> Whether you are about to marry or are still in marriage's early years, best-selling author Larry Burkett can steer you around the pitfalls that result from mishandling your money. In this valuable guide he will help you:<br> <br> � Establish a workable budget<br> � Discover what kind of insurance you need and how much<br> � Teach your children about finances<br> � Diagnose economic danger signs in your marriage<br> � Explore different types of investments and decide which are best for you and much, much more.<br> <br> Solid biblical direction, practical advice, and years of "field-testing" make this a book that won't gather dust on your shelf!<br> <br> The late Larry Burkett was founder and president of Christian Financial Concepts in Gainesville, Georgia, a nonprofit organization that specializes in teaching Christians biblical principles for managing money. The host of two daily radio programs, "How to Manage Your Money" and "Money Matters," Larry wrote numerous books on finances, including <i>Investing for the Future, The Complete Financial Guide for Single Parents, The Coming Economic Earthquake,</i> and <i>Preparing for Retirement.</i><br> <br></p><p>Following a long and courageous battle with cancer and heart disease, Larry Burkett completed his journey of serving the Lord Jesus Christ on this earth. Having battled cancer and heart attacks for the past several years, God called Larry into His presence in July 2003. <p>To say that he will be missed is a huge understatement. Larry was truly loved by all those whose lives he touched; his family, his friends and his ministry partners. He lived a life of Christian kindness and genuine humility. He was always extraordinarily generous.</p> <p>One of the central principles Larry taught is that we don't really own things; we are simply stewards and managers of what God has entrusted to us. In Larry's case, that included the ministry he founded.</p> <p>In 1971, Larry gave his life to Jesus Christ and committed to follow wherever the Lord would lead and to boldly teach the life-changing truths of Scripture. And he did this with all his might.</p> <p>In 1973, Dr. Bill Bright invited Larry and Judy to join the staff of Campus Crusade for Christ. Here he counseled the staff, many of whom were struggling financially, on how to handle money God's way.</p> <p>In 1976, he founded Christian Financial Concepts. He poured his life into serving the Lord through this ministry. He loved the ministry, he loved his staff, and he genuinely loved the people who looked to the ministry for help.</p> <p>Larry was a prolific writer, authoring more than 70 books including several best sellers. Larry's radio program was carried on more than 1,000 stations in the United States.</p> <p>His greatest desire was to see Crown Financial Ministries fulfill its God-given vision of teaching 30 million people in America and 300 million around the world to handle money God's way.</p> <p>As he told us, "This ministry is not my invention; it exists because of a calling from God. I'm not alarmed at the thought of Crown's future without me. I recognized that it was crucial to put in place leadership that can carry on and even expand this ministry. And God has been faithful to bring Crown a godly capable leadership team. God has used Crown wonderfully in past. May He use us in the future to help train millions of God's people-even after the Lord calls me home."</p> <p>I believe the impact of Larry's life will continue as future generations apply the biblical truth taught by Crown. And, God will be glorified through the ministry Larry began, one that continues by His grace.<br> Larry is survived by his wife of 44 years Judy and their four children: Allen, Kim, Danny, and Todd.<br> </p></p><h2>Three Graves Full</h2><p>A <i>Library Journal</i> Best Book of 2013!<br>A <i>Booklist</i> Best Crime Novel of 2013!<i></i><br><br><i>There is very little peace for a man with a body buried in his backyard.

It has grown from controversial cult sensation to being ranked by Total Film as the greatest horror movie ever made and shown in the permanent collection of New York&#39;s MOMA, even while the mystery and mythology around the film endures. Gunnar Hansen&#39;s fascinating literary memoir of the making of the film comes from the utterly unique perspective of having played the character of the grunting, chain saw-wielding Leatherface. A critically-acclaimed poet and author himself, Hansen tells the real story of the film, debunking myths and offering fresh insights and behind-the-scenes detail on the film&#39;s production and reception, as well as a compelling meditation on the film and the horror genre&#39;s place in pop culture today.</p><p>Holiday Gift Guide Pick- Ain&#39;t It Cool News &#34;A poet who has written several books on history, travel and poetry, Hansen has a crisp, engaging and informative style, and this is a must-read for horror film buffs.&#34; -Asbury Park Press &#34;As the masked man-child Leatherface in the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Gunnar Hansen let his homicidal character&#39;s infamous power tool do all the talking. But the Iceland-born, Austin, Tx.-bred actor and writer proves an engaging raconteur in Chain Saw Confidential. -Entertainment Weekly &#34;Gunnar Hansen gives us a detailed look at not only the making of, but also the impact of, what is now universally acknowledged as an American classic, Tobe Hooper&#39;s The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. I am just grateful this excellent read is not titled &#34;Leatherface Speaks!&#34; &#34; - John Landis, director of An American Werewolf in London &#34;I wish every notable movie had a diarist or observer as clear-eyed and thorough as Gunnar Hansen. He leads us through the amazing adventure of making The Texas Chain Saw Massacre with a steady hand-and a delicious sense of humor.&#34; -Leonard Maltin, movie critic and historian, author of Leonard Maltin&#39;s Annual Movie Guide &#34;If you&#39;ve ever wondered what it was like to work on TCM--and I know I have--this may be as close as you&#39;ll get. Gunnar leads you through the making of the film so intimately and vividly that you really a feel a part of it. The innocence and ignorance, the dedication and commitment, with more than a dash of downright madness, through the extraordinary aftermath (the missing millions, the whirlwind of opprobrium dumped on the movie by dumb critics) to the film&#39;s triumphant rise to its rightful place as the most influential horror film of the last forty years. It&#39;s all here, presented with wonderful style and wit by the Man with the Mask and the Saw himself. Whether you love the movie or hate it, whether you&#39;re a fan of horror or despise the genre, this is a must-read.&#34; -Doug Bradley, actor, Hellraiser &#34;Straight from the cracked lips of Leatherface himself comes this behind-the-scenes story of the film that changed the face of horror for all time. A terrific page-turning read, that like The Texas Chain Saw Massacre itself, doesn&#39;t skimp on the blood, sweat, or tears-beautifully told by the great Gunnar Hansen, who lived to tell the tale.&#34; -Stuart Gordon, director of Re-Animator &#34;Who knew Leatherface could wield a pen as wonderfully as he swings a chainsaw? In his addictive Chain Saw Confidential, Gunnar Hansen writes a smart, funny and wildly entertaining account of making one of the greatest triumphs in cinematic history. Packed full of surprising insights and candid backstage anecdotes, it&#39;s an essential read for genre fans and a true delight for anyone who loves a great Texas yarn..&#34;&#34; -Jason Zinoman, author of Shock Value &#34;Witty, well written, and just... amazing. Chain Saw Confidential is a refreshing look at a horror classic which has now entered the public lexicon.&#34; -Dread Central &#34;From the scripting through production-chronicled in terms of the movie&#39;s chronology, not the order of shooting-to Texas Chainsaw&#39;s reception and reputation, every bloody nook and cranny is explored here, revealing many details that will likely surprise even fans who think they&#39;ve heard it all.&#34; -Fangoria &#34;10 out of 10. A film that has managed to creep that deeply under the skin of the audience&#39;s consciousness MUST have had a truly warped and strange gestation and creation, and finally the truth can be told, by someone who was actually there at the time. Not a friend&#39;s cousin, not a second-hand account from a third party, but an honest to goodness eye witness. The actor behind the role of Leatherface, Gunnar Hansen, a sensitive and gentle writer of poetry, has penned a complete account of the filming of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, and believe us it is a riveting and stunningly well written book...can&#39;t recommend this highly enough. Chain Saw Confidential is an absolute MUST read for any horror or independent film fan.&#34; -Starburst Magazine &#34;Witty, well written, and just... amazing. &#34; Chain Saw Confidential&#34; is a refreshing look at a horror classic which has now entered the public lexicon.&#34; -Dread CentralGunnar Hansen played the character Leatherface in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, has worked as a freelance writer for the past thirty-five years and has published four books.

Fearless spy for the Confederacy, glittering Washington hostess, legendary beauty and lover, Rose Greenhow risked everything for the cause she valued more than life itself. In this superb portrait, biographer Ann Blackman tells the surprising true story of a unique woman in history. <br><br>&#x201c;I am a Southern woman, born with revolutionary blood in my veins,&#x201d; Rose once declared&#x2013;and that fiery spirit would plunge her into the center of power and the thick of adventure. Born into a slave-holding family, Rose moved to Washington, D.C., as a young woman and soon established herself as one of the capital&#x2019;s most charming and influential socialites, an intimate of John C. Calhoun, James Buchanan, and Dolley Madison. <br><br>She married well, bore eight children and buried five, and, at the height of the Gold Rush, accompanied her husband Robert Greenhow to San Francisco. Widowed after Robert died in a tragic accident, Rose became notorious in Washington for her daring&#x2013;and numerous&#x2013;love affairs.<br><br>But with the outbreak of the Civil War, everything changed. Overnight, Rose Greenhow, fashionable hostess, become Rose Greenhow, intrepid spy. As Blackman reveals, deadly accurate intelligence that Rose supplied to General Pierre G. T. Beauregard written in a fascinating code (the code duplicated in the background on the jacket of this book). Her message to Beauregard turned the tide in the first Battle of Bull Run, and was a brilliant piece of spycraft that eventually led to her arrest by Allan Pinkerton and imprisonment with her young daughter. <br><br>Indomitable, Rose regained her freedom and, as the war reached a crisis, journeyed to Europe to plead the Confederate cause at the royal courts of England and France. <br>Drawing on newly discovered diaries and a rich trove of contemporary accounts, Blackman has fashioned a thrilling, intimate narrative that reads like a novel. Wild Rose is an unforgettable rendering of an astonishing woman, a book that will stand with the finest Civil War biographies.</p><p>Ann Blackman is the author of Seasons of Her Life: A Biography of Madeleine Korbel Albright and co-author of The Spy Next Door, about the traitorous FBI agent Robert Hanssen.

She is married to Michael Putzel. They have two grown children and live in the nation&#x2019;s capital.Chapter 1<br><br>Rose&#x2019;s Game<br><br>The summer sun beat down on a wooden milk cart rumbling along a dirt road that stretched up the Washington side of the Potomac River. A long, lazy cloud of yellow dust trailed from the wheels and hung in the heavy summer air. The driver, wearing a frayed gray frock, passed one sprawling Union army encampment after another. To soldiers moving supply wagons upriver to reinforce newly dug-in positions, the slender figure seemed but a simple farm girl returning home from a morning of selling sweet cream and buttermilk at the city market.<br><br>She was, in fact, not a country girl at all, but a beautiful, well-bred sixteen-year-old named Bettie Duvall, on a secret mission to Confederate territory. It was Tuesday, July 9, 1861, and the untested troops of North and South were spoiling for their first real fight.<br><br>Heading out of the Federal City through Georgetown, Miss Duvall rode by Camp Banks at Georgetown Heights, headquarters of the First Massachusetts Infantry. Some of the soldiers had left that morning, trudging up the road to Great Falls to relieve another unit that had lost two men, shot by rebels from across the river. The two were among the first casualties of war, and the city was in mourning. The Union troops occupied themselves as best they could. &#x201c;We have received some new pants today, dark blue,&#x201d; one wrote in his diary. &#x201c;Are to have blue jackets, I believe.&#x201d;1 When he was hungry, the soldier sneaked out of camp to look for apples, gooseberries, and currants. He also picked a rose from the garden of a departed secessionist and sent it to his parents. A few soldiers beat the heat by taking a dip in the river. They had been told to be ready to march at a moment&#x2019;s notice.<br><br>All around camp, thin wisps of dark smoke curled up from cooking fires, carrying the smell of burnt sugar to hungry soldiers. Boiled rice with sugar sauce was being prepared for dinner. It was a simple meal, but the men liked the sweet taste, and it was certainly a step up from skillygalee, hard bread soaked in cold water and fried brown in pork fat. &#x201c;I must say that Uncle Sam don&#x2019;t feed his soldiers as he ought,&#x201d; wrote a soldier who signed his letter &#x201c;C.B.L.&#x201d; &#x201c;Hard crackers and salt junk is not the thing for a man to fight on.&#x201d;<br><br>Farther up the road, the cart passed Camp Winfield Scott, headquarters of the Second Michigan Infantry, &#x201c;Richardson&#x2019;s Brigade.&#x201d; It was, in the words of soldier Charles B. Haydon, &#x201c;a beautiful location,&#x201d; that rose &#x201c;almost to the dignity of mountains.&#x201d; There had been some fighting upriver two days before, and the infantrymen were eager for more action. &#x201c;I for one am ready to work &amp; give if need be all I am worth which is very little, til the last secessionist is dead or subdued,&#x201d; Haydon wrote.<br><br>The men&#x2019;s provisions were poor, and theft was a problem. Disease was worse. Measles had broken out, and the sick list lengthened daily. Many were also suffering from severe diarrhea and bloody flux, or dysentery, the result of their insufficient diet. When the surgeon expressed bafflement about how to cure it, some men took to doctoring themselves by drinking the juice of boiled blackberry root. They knew they had to get better quickly, because they had been ordered to pack their knapsacks and expected to move out that night.<br><br>A mile beyond the camp, the cart turned sharply left and rattled onto the loose old boards of Chain Bridge. Union artillerymen at Battery Martin Scott, a new, two-tiered stone-and-turf fortification overlooking the bridge, could see the cart and driver from their outpost with its commanding, panoramic view of the Potomac. Twelve-pounder guns mounted at the end of the bridge could sweep the span, and one hundred feet up the hill, three big forty-two-pounders could rake not just the bridge, but the heights beyond. The Union cannoneers used an old stone mill on the opposite side of the Potomac to get their range. But the cart made its way peacefully across. No one stopped the driver.<br><br>Bettie Duvall continued up the road. She had left the city hours earlier and had not even gone halfway to her uncertain destination.<br><br>Despite regular reports of Confederate soldiers lurking around their camps, Union troops controlled both banks of the river, including the northern edge of Virginia from Alexandria below the capital to encampments all along Arlington Heights and up to Chain Bridge. Colonel William Tecumseh Sherman had command of the three New York regiments and the Second Wisconsin Infantry assigned to protect the far side of the river.<br><br>The weather had been intensely hot, interrupted only by severe afternoon thunderstorms. During those brief, violent downpours, water rushed through the soldiers&#x2019; tents like a river, soaking knapsacks and forcing them to sleep on raised boards. Confederate patrols fired across the river at Union encampments at night, and the Union forces returned fire, reporting some casualties. Everyone was on edge.<br><br>Bettie Duvall drove her cart up a steep hill into the Virginia countryside. The road was narrow and badly cut by wagon wheels, slowing her progress. While most of the Union wagons and artillery were behind her, the young Southerner had to look out for Yankee scouts and pickets.<br><br>Not wanting to travel after nightfall, which would increase the danger, she stopped at Sharon, a plantation on the Georgetown &amp; Leesburg Road just west of the village of Langley. It was owned by the family of her friend Lieutenant Catesby R. Jones. Jones had resigned his post as an officer in the United States Navy and left to join the Confederate navy when Virginia seceded from the Union three months earlier, but the family still lived in the ancestral home. The next morning, Miss Duvall changed into a stylish riding habit, abandoned her humble cart, borrowed a saddle horse, and cantered off in the direction of Lewinsville and Tyson Cross roads, where travelers sometimes stopped in a peach grove to rest.<br><br>The dirt road took her past deserted wooden houses and farms with weathered ox fences and through undulating fields of ripening wheat and Indian corn. She headed for the village of Fairfax Court House, some twenty miles west of Washington and only ten miles north of Manassas Junction, the Confederate headquarters of General Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard. The Louisiana native, hero of Fort Sumter, had just arrived at Manassas from Charleston to take command of the Confederate Army of the Potomac.<br><br>Near Vienna, Miss Duvall came upon a Confederate outpost and was ordered to halt. The Confederate soldiers, whose gray jackets had already faded to butternut by the relentless sun and yellow dust, had dug trenches in the road and felled thick trees to slow the Union army&#x2019;s expected advance. At last, she had reached friendly territory.<br><br>Miss Duvall told the pickets she had come to see Brigadier General Milledge Luke Bonham, a South Carolina politician who days before had been ordered to relinquish his command of the army to Beauregard, a professional soldier. Bonham, who remained as the general&#x2019;s top aide, was at Fairfax Court House, about five miles to the south. The soldiers escorted their charge to Bonham&#x2019;s headquarters, where she tied her horse to the bough of a tree. But when the general learned of his visitor, he at first refused to see her, fearing she was yet another lady spy dispatched by the Federals to assess the strength of the Confederate army. Told that the young woman was prepared to take her message to Beauregard herself and also, perhaps more important, that she was &#x201c;very pretty,&#x201d; Bonham relented. &#x201c;I was very much startled,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;at recognizing the face of a beautiful young lady, a brunette, with sparkling black eyes, perfect features, glossy black hair.&#x201d; Bonham, who seven months before had been a congressman from South Carolina, remembered seeing Bettie Duvall in the spectator gallery of the House of Representatives, a frequent gathering spot for Southern ladies.<br><br>When she told him the content of her message and he agreed to forward it to his commander, Miss Duvall reached back, took a tuck comb from a chignon of long, silky hair that had been wound gracefully around her head, and shook loose her locks. Bonham watched spellbound as a tiny bag fell out. It was not larger than a silver dollar and had been carefully stitched out of a torn piece of glossy black silk, the kind used in the finest of mourning clothes. The purse contained a slip of white paper with a combination of numbers and letters written in bold handwriting with black ink: 054 1 7 3.

Special attention is given to the practice of &#x201c;baby brokering&#x201d; and the accompanying exorbitant finder&#x2019;s fees and financial incentives encouraging birth mothers to relinquish (or pretend that they are planning to relinquish) their babies that permeate much of U.S. infant adoption today.<br><br>The Children Money Can Buy illuminates the worlds of foster care and adoption through the personal stories Moody witnessed and experienced in her many years working in the foster care and adoption systems. These compelling stories about real people and situations illustrate larger life lessons about the way our society values&#x2014;and fails to value&#x2014;parents and children. They explore the root of ethical problems which are not only financially driven but reflect society&#x2019;s basic belief that some children are more valuable than others. Finally, Moody makes a plea for change and gives suggestions about how the foster care and adoption systems could work together for the benefit of children and families.</p><p>Anne Moody has enjoyed a long career in child welfare work and adoption counseling. Since the early 1980s, she has worked to improve upon the infant adoption process for both birth and adoptive parents. Anne is the Director of Adoption Connections in Bainbridge Island, Washington, and is also an adoptive parent.As a young 20-something with a master&#x2019;s degree in social work, Moody took a job as a child-welfare caseworker that introduced her to the world of adoptions and foster care, beginning a lifelong commitment that is chronicled in this compassionate work. Moody touches on the adoption sector&#x2019;s ugly side, such as &#x2018;baby buying&#x2019; and profit-driven adoption facilitators. She takes care to counterbalance these negatives, however, by also detailing the positive changes that have occurred in the field over the course of her career. These include the increasing acceptance of &#x2018;open adoptions,&#x2019; in which birth parents are allowed to play some role in their children&#x2019;s lives, and of same-sex couples as adopters. Throughout, Moody shares the personal experiences of many children and parents (whose identities are protected), some happy, some sad. The author also recalls her commitment at 13 to eventually become an adoptive parent, a dream she made real 23 years later. Moody's experiences certainly inform her practical approach, which touches on subjects including how to talk about adoption with children and how adoptive families can present themselves to the outside world. For any family that has faced the difficult issues of adoption or fostering from any perspective, Moody's book will be a valuable tool. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>Anne Moody&#x2019;s insightful book captures the dynamic world of adoption. From her vantage point as a social worker and an adoptive mom, she provides compelling behind the scenes anecdotes that span state, international and domestic adoption. It&#x2019;s a great read for anyone exploring adoption. (Shari Levine, Executive Director, Open Adoption and Family Services)<br><br>Anne Moody&#x2019;s writing helps open wide the heart. A perfectly arranged mixture of memoir and analysis, The Children Money Can Buy looks back over the author&#x2019;s long career of helping people navigate the shifting and confusing landscape of foster care and adoption, and helps the reader draw valuable lessons from her experience. Her stories are moving, instructive, and unforgettable, told in a voice that fills the reader with respect and trust. (Rebecca Wells, author of <i>Divine Secrets of the YaYa Sisterhood<i>)<br><br>With the tenderness of memoir and the reach of great nonfiction, Anne Moody&#x2019;s The Children Money Can Buy examines the modern history of adoption from every angle. Moody draws on her own experiences to give us a book that is not just exhaustively researched, but personally lived. The result is deeply informative, yes, but also an intimate glimpse inside the adoption experience. (Claire Dederer, author of <i>Poser: My Life in Twenty-Three Yoga Poses<i>)<br><br>I&#x2019;ve read a lot of books on adoption and the foster care system, but none by an author with the breadth and depth of experience Anne has...she presents a fair and well-considered view of the matters at hand, and her persona on the page is inviting and winning. Anne&#x2019;s work sheds new light on an important topic we rarely hear about. What Anne has to say stands a good chance to make this world a better place.

Hall, <em>American Anthropologist</em></strong></p><h2>Einstein&#39;s German World (Allen Lane History)</h2><p>Albert Einstein was, it has seemed to some scholars, a genius <i>sui generis</i>; a man who transcended his own time and native country to become a citizen of the world. Fritz Stern is not among their ranks. A retired professor of history at Columbia University, Stern here offers a set of essays on the cultural milieu of late 19th- and early 20th-century Germany, and more specifically of the brilliant culture of German Jews, many of whom had, like Einstein, been largely assimilated into the surrounding culture in what Stern calls "an astounding ascendancy" but who were forced by separatist laws to accept second-class status. Chaim Weizmann, a chemist of Einstein's generation who founded modern Zionism, knew this well; when one of his teachers assured him that Germans would give up their anti-Semitism once they realised how much Jews had contributed to their prosperity and their rich culture, Weizmann replied, "Herr Doktor, if a man has a piece of something in his eye, he doesn't want to know whether it's a piece of mud or a piece of gold. He just wants to get it out." <p> The intellectuals of Albert Einstein's generation spun gold, Stern shows. Their number included Paul Ehrlich, the inventor of chemotherapy; Walther Rathenau, a captain of industry with an informed love of literature and music; and Fritz Haber, a physicist who discovered a means of fixing nitrogen from the air. All were swept away, murdered or sent into exile, by the events of the 1920s and 30s. </p><p> Surveying the ruins of World War II, the French philosopher Raymond Aron remarked to Stern, "It could have been Germany's century"--if only, that is, Germany had not succumbed to the madness of national socialism.

The world she entered was one of hard labor, poverty, dirt, disease, and frequent early death. By the 1970s, that rural world had changed almost beyond recognition. <i>Toshi� </i>is the story of that extraordinary transformation as witnessed and experienced by Toshi� herself. A sweeping social history of the Japanese countryside in its twentieth-century transition from "peasant" to "consumer" society, the book is also a richly textured account of the life of one village woman and her community caught up in the inexorable march of historical events. <br><br>Through the lens of Toshi�'s life, Simon Partner shows us the realities of rural Japanese life during the 1930s depression; daily existence under the wartime regime of "spiritual mobilization"; the land reform and its consequences during occupation; and the rapid emergence of a consumer culture against the background of agricultural mechanization during the 1950s and 1960s. In some ways representative and in other ways unique, Toshi�'s narrative raises questions about conventional frameworks of twentieth-century Japanese history, and about the place of individual agency and choice in an era often seen as dominated by the impersonal forces of modernity: technology, state power, and capitalism.</p><p>"Within the lively and often gripping story of Sakaue Toshi� and her world, Partner gives us a sweeping and thought-provoking history of social change in rural Japan and sheds new light on key developments such as war mobilization and US occupation reforms.

In 1972 he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize along with Bernstein and Herblock for his coverage of Watergate. Yet this black man, who has served the United States so well, feels at times an unwelcome guest here.<br><br>In <i>Jefferson's Pillow,</i> Wilkins returns to America's beginnings and the founding fathers who preached and fought for freedom, even though they owned other human beings and legally denied them their humanity. He asserts that the mythic accounts of the American Revolution have ignored slavery and oversimplified history until the heroes, be they the founders or the slaves in their service, are denied any human complexity.<br><br>Wilkins offers a thoughtful analysis of this fundamental paradox through his exploration of the lives of George Washington, George Mason, James Madison, and of course Thomas Jefferson. He discusses how class, education, and personality allowed for the institution of slavery, unravels how we as Americans tell different sides of that story, and explores the confounding ability of that narrative to limit who we are and who we can become.<br><br>An important intellectual history of America's founding, <i>Jefferson's Pillow </i>will change the way we view our nation and ourselves.</p><p>Roger Wilkins, currently the Clarence J.

Wilkins' book has made a mirror of the past in which we glimpse our own shortcomings -and perhaps even the means for transcending them." --Philip Connors, <i>In These Times</i><br><br>"Wilkins makes a case for his opinions in sentences that enchant and inform. In its persuasive blend of logic and lyricism, Wilkins's language at its most potent is positively . . . Jeffersonian." --Jabari Asim, <i>Washington Post Book World</i><br><br>"With a sense of genuine curiosity Wilkins tried to avoid either condemning the founders too easily by modern standards or excusing too easily the contradictions of their slave ownership. Instead, by exploring the culture and atmosphere in which they grew up, he discovered how much slavery was an integral part of the Virginia society that enabled the founders to create the recipe for modern rights, equality and democracy." --Clarence Page, <i>Chicago Tribune</i><br><br>"Wilkins, who describes himself as a 'deeply committed American,' is never less than a patriot here; someone indifferent about America could not write such a thoughtful book. He demythologizes the Founding Fathers, yet expands their greatness by placing it within the context of the times, as well as their flawed humanity."<i>--Boston Globe</i><br><br>"When the Founding Fathers were deciding whether to risk their lives and fortunes for their ideals, Benjamin Franklin remarked: 'We must all indeed all hang together, or most assuredly we shall hang separately.' In the years after their bold gamble for freedom, the hangman's noose played a far darker role in our republic, becoming the lynch mob's weapon of choice for denying African-Americans their inalienable rights. Liberty and freedom, repression and racism, these warring yet braided strands form the Gordian knot of the American experience: A land of visionary light entwined in the darkest recesses of human cruelty. Now comes Roger Wilkins like a modern-day Alexander to cut this knot." --J. Peder Zane, <i>Raleigh News and Observer</i><br><br>"Roger Wilkins is one of our most gifted social commentators. In <i>Jefferson's Pillow,</i> he explores with great eloquence and passion the ultimate contradiction of our society-between being a free American, a descendant of slavery, and the beneficiary of those who went before him." --David Halberstam, author of <i>War in a Time of Peace</i></p><h2>Single Jewish Male Seeking Soul Mate</h2><p>Feminist icon Letty Cottin Pogrebin's second novel is the story of Zach Levy, the left-leaning son of Holocaust survivors who promises his mother on her deathbed that he will marry within the tribe and raise Jewish children.

In <i>Learning the Hard Way</i>, Edward W. Morris explores and analyzes detailed ethnographic data on this purported gender gap between boys and girls in educational achievement at two low-income high schools&#x2014;one rural and predominantly white, the other urban and mostly African American. Crucial questions arose from his study of gender at these two schools. Why did boys tend to show less interest in and more defiance toward school? Why did girls significantly outperform boys at both schools? Why did people at the schools still describe boys as especially &#x201c;smart&#x201d;?</p><p>Morris examines these questions and, in the process, illuminates connections of gender to race, class, and place. This book is not simply about the educational troubles of boys, but the troubled and complex experience of gender in school. It reveals how particular race, class, and geographical experiences shape masculinity and femininity in ways that affect academic performance. His findings add a new perspective to the &#x201c;gender gap&#x201d; in achievement.</p></p><p><p>EDWARD W. MORRIS is an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Kentucky and the author of <i>An Unexpected Minority: White Kids in an Urban School</i> (Rutgers University Press). </p>"Differences in school performance related to gender represent one of the more enduring discussions in education and psychology. Explanations have ranged from differences attributed purely to the way young people are socialized, to differences that are fundamentally biological. Based on an ethnographic study of poor students in two schools Morris has synthesized an explanation making economic circumstances, something described as 'place,' a critical element in shaping gender differences.

The rich and the poor, the pious and the fallen, the living and the dead&#x2014;all collide and interconnect with the body pulled from the lake.<br> <br> Breathtakingly bold and intricately constructed, <i>The Wolf and the Watchman</i> brings to life the crowded streets, gilded palaces, and dark corners of late-eighteenth-century Stockholm, offering a startling vision of the crimes we commit in the name of justice, and the sacrifices we make in order to survive.</p><p>Niklas Natt och Dag (&#x201c;Night and Day&#x201d;) is a member of the oldest surviving noble family in Sweden.

Please wake up!&#x201d;<br> <br>As an agitated shaking rouses Cardell from his slumber, he feels a fleeting ache in the left arm he no longer owns. A carved wooden arm has taken the place of the missing limb. His stump rests in a hollow space inside the beechwood, attached at the elbow with the aid of leather straps. They are cutting into his flesh. He should know better by now and have loosened them before nodding off.<br> <br>Reluctantly, he opens his eyes and stares out across the vast plain of the stained table. When he makes an attempt to lift his head, his cheek sticks to the wooden surface and he inadvertently pulls his wig off as he stands up. He curses and uses it to wipe his brow before tucking it inside his jacket. His hat rolls down onto the floor, its crown dented. He punches it out and then pulls it onto his head. His memory is beginning to return. He is at Cellar Hamburg and must have drunk himself senseless. A glance over his shoulder reveals others in a similar condition. The few drunks that the proprietor considered affluent enough not to toss into the gutter are sprawled over benches and across tables, until the morning, when they will stagger away to receive the reproaches of those waiting at home. Not so for Cardell. A crippled war veteran, he lives alone and his time is no one&#x2019;s but his own.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mickel, you&#x2019;ve got to come! There&#x2019;s a dead body in the Larder!&#x201d;<br> <br>The two youngsters who have roused him are guttersnipes. Their faces look familiar but he is unable to recall their names. Behind them stands the Ram, the well-nourished manager who works for Widow Norstr�m, the owner. The Ram is groggy and flushed and has positioned himself between the children and a collection of etched glass: the pride of the cellar, stored behind lock and key in a blue cabinet.<br> <br>The condemned stop here at Cellar Hamburg on their way to the Sconce Tollgate and to the gallows beyond. At the steps of the Hamburg they are served their last drink, after which the glass is carefully retrieved, etched with name and date, and added to the collection. The patrons may drink from one of these only under supervision and upon payment of a fee based on the degree of infamy of the condemned. It is said to bring good fortune. Cardell has never understood the reasoning.<br> <br>Cardell rubs his eyes and realizes he is still inebriated. His voice is thick when he tries it.<br> <br>&#x201c;What the devil is going on?&#x201d;<br> <br>It is the older one&#x2014;a girl&#x2014;who answers. The boy is harelipped, and her brother, to judge by his features. He wrinkles his nose at Cardell&#x2019;s breath and takes cover behind his sister.<br> <br>&#x201c;There is a body in the water, right at the edge.&#x201d;<br> <br>Her tone is a blend of terror and excitement. The veins in Cardell&#x2019;s forehead feel close to bursting. The pounding of his heart threatens to drown out what feeble thoughts he tries to muster.<br> <br>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s this my problem?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Please, Mickel, there isn&#x2019;t anyone else and we knew that you were here.&#x201d;<br> <br>He rubs his temples in a vain hope of easing the throbbing pain.<br> <br><br> <br>Above the Southern Isle, the skies have not yet begun to lighten. Cardell staggers out and down the steps of the Hamburg and follows the children along the empty street, halfheartedly listening to a story about a thirsty cow that reared up at the water&#x2019;s edge and took off in terror in the direction of Danto.<br> <br>&#x201c;Her muzzle touched the body and made it spin in a circle.&#x201d;<br> <br>Underfoot the stones give way to mud as they get closer to the lake. Cardell&#x2019;s duties have not carried him past the shores of the Larder in a long time, but he sees that nothing has changed. Nothing has come of the long-held plans to clean the shoreline and build a quay with piers, though this is hardly any cause of wonder when both city and state teeter on the brink of ruin. The fine houses around the lake have long since been repurposed into manufactories. The workshops throw their waste directly into the water, and the fenced section intended for human waste is overflowing and ignored by most. Cardell lets out a colorful phrase when his bootheel ploughs a furrow in the muck and he has to flap his healthy arm to maintain his balance.<br> <br>&#x201c;Your cow was frightened by an encounter with an overripe cousin. The butchers throw their scraps into the lake. You&#x2019;ve woken me up for nothing more than a rancid side of beef or some pig&#x2019;s rib cage.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We saw a face in the water, a person&#x2019;s face.&#x201d;<br> <br>The waves lap against the shore, churning up a pale yellow froth. Something rotten&#x2014;a dark lump&#x2014;is floating a few meters out. Cardell&#x2019;s first thought is that it cannot possibly be a human being. It is too small.<br> <br>&#x201c;Like I said, it&#x2019;s butcher&#x2019;s scraps. An animal carcass.&#x201d;<br> <br>The girl insists she is not mistaken. The boy nods in agreement. Cardell snorts in surrender.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m drunk, you hear? Dead drunk. Soused. You&#x2019;ll not forget this when someone asks about the time you tricked the watchman into taking a dip in the Larder and how he gave you both the thrashing of your lives when he came up again, soaked and enraged.&#x201d;<br> <br>He works his way out of his coat with the awkwardness of the one-handed. The forgotten woollen wig falls out of the lining, into the slush. Never mind. The miserable thing only cost a pittance and the fashion is on its way out. He wears it only because a more proper appearance improves the chances that someone will stand a war veteran a drink or two. Cardell casts a glance at the sky. High above, a band of distant stars shine over �rsta Bay. He closes his eyes to seal the impression of beauty inside him and steps into the lake, right leg first.<br> <br>The boggy edge doesn&#x2019;t support his weight. He sinks down as far as his knee and feels the lake water pouring over the edge of his boot, which remains stuck in the sludge as his involuntary fall forwards pulls his leg along. With something between a crawl and a doggy-paddle, he begins to make his way farther out. The water is thick between his fingers, full of things that even the residents of the Southern Isle don&#x2019;t consider worth keeping.<br> <br>His intoxication has impaired his sense of judgment. He feels a stab of panic when he no longer has the lake bottom under his feet. This water is deeper than anticipated and he finds himself back at Svensksund three years ago, terrified and tossed by the waves, with the Swedish front drawing back.<br> <br>He grasps the body in the water once his kicking has carried him close enough. His first thought is that he was correct. This cannot be a human being. It is a discarded carcass, tossed here by the butcher&#x2019;s boys, made into a buoy as the gases of decomposition expand its innards. Then the lump rolls over and shows him its face.<br> <br>It isn&#x2019;t rotten at all, and yet empty eye sockets stare back at him. Behind the torn lips there are no teeth. The hair alone has retained its luster&#x2014;the night and the lake have done their best to dim its color, but it is without a doubt a mass of light blond hair. Cardell&#x2019;s sudden intake of breath fills his mouth with water and causes him to choke.<br> <br>When his coughing fit has subsided, he floats motionless next to the corpse, studying its ravaged features. Back on the shore, the children make no sound. They await his return in silence. He grabs the body, turns around in the water, and starts to kick with his bare foot to make his way back towards land.<br> <br>The recovery effort becomes more laborious when he reaches the muddy embankment and the water no longer carries their weight. Cardell rolls over onto his back and kicks his way up with both legs, dragging his quarry by its ragged covering. The children do not help him. Instead, they back away cowering, holding their noses. Cardell clears his throat of the filthy pond water and spits into the mud.<br> <br>&#x201c;Run to the Lock and tell the Corpses.&#x201d;<br> <br>The children make no move to comply, as eager to keep their distance as they are to get a glimpse of Cardell&#x2019;s catch. Only when he tosses a handful of muck at them do they set off.<br> <br>&#x201c;Run to the night post and get me a fucking bluecoat, damn it!&#x201d;<br> <br>When their small feet are out of earshot, he leans over to the side and vomits. Stillness descends, and in his isolation, Cardell feels a cold embrace pressing all air out of his lungs, making it impossible to draw the next breath. His heart beats faster and faster, the blood throbs in the veins in his throat, and he is overcome with a paralyzing fear. He knows all too well what comes next. He feels the arm that is no longer his solidify out of the surrounding darkness until every part of his being tells him it is back where it once was, and with it a pain searing enough to cancel the world itself out, as a jaw with teeth of iron gnaws flesh, bone, and gristle.<br> <br>In a state of panic, he tears at the leather straps and lets the wooden arm fall into the mud. He grabs his stump with his right hand and massages the scarred flesh to force his senses to accept that the arm they perceive no longer exists and that the wound is long since healed.<br> <br>The seizure lasts no more than a minute. Breath returns, first in shallow gasps and then in calmer, slower inhalations. The terror subsides and the world regains its familiar contours. These sudden panic attacks have plagued him for the past three years, ever since he returned from the war, one arm and one friend poorer. And yet that was all a long time ago now. He thought he had found a method to keep the nightmares at bay. Strong drink and bar brawls. Cardell looks around, as if for something to soothe himself with, but he and the corpse are alone. He sways side to side holding his stump in a firm grasp.</p><h2>Richard III and The Princes in the Tower</h2><p><b>Alison Weir investigates one of the most enduring murder mysteries in English history -- the death of the lost Princes in the tower, nephews of Richard III, whose body has recently been discovered.</b> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story of the death, in sinister circumstances, of the boy-king Edward V and his younger brother Richard, Duke of York, is one of the most fascinating murder mysteries in English history. It is a tale with profound moral and social consequences, rich in drama, intrigue, treason, scandal and violence. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this gripping book Alison Weir re-examines all the evidence -- including that against the Princes' uncle, Richard III, whose body was recently discovered beneath a Leicester car park. She brilliantly reconstructs the whole chain of events leading to their murder and reveals how, why and by whose order they died.</p><p>Alison Weir goes to contemporary sources to unravel the fate of the sons of Edward lV, the princes in the Tower of London. These sources include the account of Dominic Mancini, an Italian monk who was in England from 1482-July 1483 as part of a French delegation and the Croyland Chronicles. Other writers, including novelists Josephine Tey and Sharon Kay Penmann, have examined the disappearance of Edward V and his younger brother. I won't tell you Weir's conclusions, but I will say that she is very persuasive in her reasoning. I highly recommend PRINCES IN THE TOWER to any fans of British Royal history.<br><br>Randy Hickernell, Ballantine Sales Rep1espite five centuries of investigation by historians, the sinister deaths of the boy king Edward V and his younger brother Richard, Duke of York, remain one of the most fascinating murder mysteries in English history. Did Richard III really kill "the Princes in the Tower," as is commonly believed, or was the murderer someone else entirely?<p>In this utterly absorbing and meticulously researched book, English writer Alison Weir, an authority on the history of the British royal family, at last provides a conclusive solution to this age-old puzzle. Carefully examining every shred of contemporary evidence as well as the dozens of modern accounts, Weir reconstructs the entire chain of events leading to the double murder.</p><p>In The Princes in the Tower we are witnesses to the tumultuous reign of Edward IV, the princes' powerful, handsome, promiscuous father. We see the unfolding rivalry between the Wydvilles, the common family of Edward's shrewd queen, and Richard, Duke of Gloucester, his ambitious brother. Finally we are swept up in the vortex of intrigue that followed Edward's death - the naming of his twelve-year-old son Edward as heir; Richard's swift arrival in London and his lightning strike for power; the imprisonment of the princes in the Tower of London; and the hushed-up murders that secured Richard's claim to the throne as Richard III.</p><p>Weir considers in turn each of the prime suspects in the murder: the grasping, conspiratorial Duke of Buckingham; the shadowy Sir James Tyrell, Richard's trusted retainer; the possibility that the boys may have died of natural causes; and of course, Richard III himself, a complex man of charm and intelligence twisted by a ruthless ambition for power.</p><p>More than an historical murder mystery, The Princes in the Tower is a richly detailed tapestry of English court life in the late fifteenth century - the bitter rivalries that exploded in the Wars of the Roses; the splendor and corruption of the royal family; the violence and treachery that coexisted with exquisite beauty and refinement. At the very center of that tapestry is the tragic image of two pale, innocent, bewildered boys, an image that has haunted our minds for half a millennium. Powerfully written, persuasively argued, and totally mesmerizing to read, The Princes in the Tower is at once a masterpiece of historical research and a riveting story of conspiracy, murder, and deception.</p></p><h2>New York City high school basketball</h2><p>New York City high school basketball</p><p></p><h2>A Grave Peril (Bodies of Evidence, 3)</h2><p><strong>Sometimes at night, she can hear the dead calling</strong><br><br>Julie Hall&#x2019;s job is to find bodies.

The next morning, they find their front yard in shambles, and a small bundle cowering on their doorstep. It's a puppy! A cute, darling little mutt they decide to call Angel. They soon learn, however, that Angel is no ordinary puppy, especially when the moon is full..... Hoffman and her teenage son's delightful tale of the challenges of owning a were-puppy is charmingly illustrated by acclaimed artist Yumi Heo.</p><p>Alice Hoffman is the highly acclaimed author of over twenty novels for readers of all ages, including Illumination Night, Seventh Heaven, Practical Magic, Here on Earth, The Foretelling, Incantation, and, most recently, The Story Sisters and The Red Garden. Her previous novels for Scholastic Press are Aquamarine, which was made into a major motion picture, Indigo, and Green Angel, which Publishers Weekly, in a boxed, starred review, called &#34;achingly lovely.&#34; She lives with her family outside of Boston. Visit her at www.alicehoffman.com.Kindergarten-Grade 3&#x2013;One September, when the moon is full, a basket is left on the McKenzie family's porch. In it is the "sweetest, most darling puppy anyone had ever seen." Michael and Hazel have always wanted a dog, and even their parents cannot resist this Angel of a pooch. This is no ordinary puppy, however. After he disappears one night, the children learn that he changes into a destructive werepup when the moon is full. They follow his tracks to the spooky house of old Miss Eleanor Mingle and her even scarier old dog, Bunny. Not only do Hazel and Michael gain an understanding of their special pup, but they also come to understand the old woman. Together they plan a party for the next full moon, which just happens to fall on Halloween. Miss Mingle is reintroduced to the townsfolk, the weredogs are (mostly) controlled by the concoction that she developed for them to eat, and all ends well. Though the theme of not judging by outward appearance is none too subtle and readers may question some of the internal logic, the story is fluidly told. Heo's appealing illustrations combine bold colors, intricate patterns, and varied perspectives. They go a long way in enhancing the pacing and tension and in making this unusual Halloween tale (mostly) satisfying.<i>&#x2013;Maria B.

Off the coast, on Ship Island, stood a fort that had once been a Union prison housing Confederate captives. Protecting the fort was the second regiment of the Louisiana Native Guards -- one of the Union's first official black units. Trethewey's new book of poems pays homage to the soldiers who served and whose voices have echoed through her own life.<br><br>The title poem imagines the life of a former slave stationed at the fort, who is charged with writing letters home for the illiterate or invalid POWs and his fellow soldiers. Just as he becomes the guard of Ship Island's memory, so Trethewey recalls her own childhood as the daughter of a black woman and a white man. Her parents' marriage was still illegal in 1966 Mississippi. The racial legacy of the Civil War echoes through elegiac poems that honor her own mother and the forgotten history of her native South. Native Guard is haunted by the intersection of national and personal experience.</p><p>Natasha Trethewey is the author of two previously published collections, Belloq&#x2019;s Ophelia and Domestic Work. In addition to the Pulitzer Prize, she was the recipient of the Cave Canem Poetry Prize, a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Grolier Poetry Prize, and a Pushcart Prize. She teaches creative writing at Emory University.<br>The frontispiece of Natasha Trethewey's Native Guard informs me she was born in Gulfport, Miss., that her mother was black and her father white. Reasonable deduction (assuming the "I" of the poems is the poet) tells me that, in her formative years, issues pertaining to her biracial heritage were exacerbated by Mississippi's legacy of oppression -- its dark, buried history. In a region struggling to confront its past, how was a young poet supposed to learn to accept who she was?<p> Trethewey's personal dilemma must have been awkward, full of tangled emotions and memorable embarrassments. It's the kind of background that has humbled many people into silence. And yet, for the purposes of literature, aren't these kinds of growing pains priceless? We should probably envy this poet's peculiar destiny. Not only has Trethewey chosen speech rather than silence, she has chosen to express herself in verse. Given her material, she could easily write essays or a memoir. But she has a genuine gift for verse forms, and the depth of her engagement in language marks her as a true poet. </p><p> In Native Guard, Trethewey traces the buried history of the South to the point where her personal narrative begins. "In 1965, my parents broke two laws of Mississippi;/ they went to Ohio to marry, returned to Mississippi," begins a ghazal (a poem in two-line stanzas linked by a rhyme scheme) titled "Miscegenation." "My Mother Dreams of Another Country" jumps ahead to Trethewey's birth year and depicts her mother's distress: "This is 1966 -- she is married to a white man -- / and there are more names for what grows inside her./ It is enough to worry about words like mongrel/ and the infertility of mules and mulattoes."</p><p> The title poem is a 10-sonnet sequence in which the last line of each sonnet becomes a variant of the subsequent sonnet's opening line, creating a lovely, wreathlike effect. The graceful form conceals a gritty subject. "Native Guard" is a first-person narrative of an unnamed ex-slave who has joined the Union army to serve in an all-black regiment. The lines have a stately, chiming perfection. The circular form mirrors the bizarre circularity of circumstance that finds the narrator -- once a slave -- now guarding Confederates who have been captured and imprisoned inside the Union fort at Ship Island, Miss. The narrator compares his life in bondage to his life as a military officer, guarding the fallen rebels: </p><p>I now use ink to keep record, a closed book, not the lure of memory -- flawed, changeful -- that dulls the lash for the master, sharpens it for the slave.</p><p>For the slave, having a master sharpens the bend into work, the way the sergeant moves us now to perfect battalion drill, dress parade.</p><p> Trethewey doesn't try to reproduce the way this character would actually speak. Whereas many poets would have spiced his monologue with dialect, she doesn't. Though a former slave, he is literate; he writes letters for his fellow soldiers. "I listen, put down in ink what I know/ they labor to say between silences." Trethewey gives her narrator a literary voice -- the voice of a 19th-century writer practiced in the diction and oratory of his time, of Frederick Douglass's masterful autobiographies, a voice that echoes the rhythms of great Western poetry. </p><p> Trethewey has a gift for squeezing the contradictions of the South into very tightly controlled lines. A certain staid, formal approach is both her strength and the only possible grounds I have to criticize her poetry. Native Guard is a small book, containing mostly short poems, a few of which read like exercises. When poets find their voices, form and content intermesh seamlessly. One can still see Trethewey's technique and feel the influence of poetry workshops. One feels a bit let down when a poem sets up an interesting emotional crisis, then resolves it almost too quickly. One feels at times as though her poems are succinct for the sake of making them work, rather than fulfilling either the poet's memory of her experience or the reader's heightened expectations. </p><p> Trethewey's style is reserved, even cautious, though her subjects are emotionally charged, even violent. This creates an interesting dichotomy, especially in poems such as "Pastoral" with its touchy image of Trethewey confronting the great white Southern poets -- Allen Tate, Robert Penn Warren and others -- while in blackface. Though this is her third book, Trethewey is still perfecting her voice and may have only scratched the surface of her remarkable talent. </p><p>Reviewed by Darryl Lorenzo Wellington <br>Copyright 2006, The Washington Post.

It provides a thorough foundation for those new to the practice, supports continued practice for those already familiar with the exercises, and helps people engaged in any form of yogic exercise to deepen the potent fusion of meditation and physical movement. <br><br>The book includes an overview of the unique tradition of Buddhist yoga; presentations on the three foundational principles of renunciation, compassionate bodhichitta, and the profound view of reality; and an explanation of the three aspects&#x2014;body, mind, and subtle body&#x2014;that comprise our whole being. There are instructions on how to work with the body and mind in seated meditation and discussion that explores ways we can further our practice by working with adversities such as fear, procrastination, and anxiety and by looking at how to bring practice mind into daily life.

Tapply is the popular author of twenty-two Brady Coyne mystery novels, and ten highly praised books on hunting and fishing. He contributes to all of the major outdoor magazines and is Professory of English and Writer in Residence at Clark University.This collection of 29 essays by the author of the Brady Coyne mystery series arrives just in time for the flurry of spring and early summer trout and bass fishing. In his eleventh fishing book, Tapply pursues trout throughout the U.S., Canada, and Patagonia. He stalks bass and striped bass across New England and travels to Guyana and Belize for permit, tarpon, and bonefish. Many of these essays revisit favorite topics from earlier work&#x2014;teamwork, friendships, the joys of small trout streams and simple bass fishing&#x2014;but they never feel repetitive. As always, Tapply shines in capturing a fishing locale's ambience and in describing arcane fishing techniques clearly and simply, as he does here in reflecting on bass bug fishing and on short fly rods. He also writes affectionately and wistfully about his father, devoted angler H. G. Tapply, who died in 2002. Among fishing and nature writers, Tapply stands out for his assured prose, his good nature, and always solid angling advice. Rowen, John <br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Fusco has curated exhibitions and public programs for London&#39;s ICA, The Brooklyn Museum, and several other venues. Brian Wallis is Director of Exhibitions and Chief Curator at the International Center of Photography. In addition to authoring many books on contemporary art, he has contributed to numerous publications, including Artforum, Art in America, Aperture, the Washington Post, the New York Times, and the Village Voice. He has taught at Yale University, Williams College, New York University, and the City University of New York.From its very beginnings, photography has been inextricably linked with racial typography, pornography, commodification and exploitation. This deeply questioning collection of 300 color photos and illustrations, along with essays, accompanies a national touring exhibition curated by the International Center of Photography's Wallis and artist Fusco (The Bodies that Were Not Ours). The collection exhumes and re-examines the "dark" underbelly of American race relations as related by historical photographs, and along the way makes valuable re-discoveries, including that the "Migrant Mother" in Dorothea Lange's celebrated Depression-era photograph, Florence Thompson, was of Cherokee descent. Aleta M. Ringlero relates how one response to her research on "Prairie Pinups," erotic photographs of American Indian women, was "we like to forget those kinds of photographs are in our collection." Demonstrating the book's intent to raise questions, not bury them, the contributors are allowed to disagree with each other: Kobena Mercer ultimately finds that Robert Mapplethorpe's photographs of black men "can be seen as a subversive deconstruction of the hidden racial and gendered axioms of the nude," while Lauri Firstenberg finds them "a contemporary example of photography's categorization and classification of subjects by stereotype." Despite their number, however, the images are underplayed-sparsely scattered through texts and printed small, they are left largely unexplained (in fact, the footnotes, placed directly underneath the photographs, are easily mistaken for captions) and photographs cited in the texts often seem not included. It will be a disappointment to many readers that the actual photographic evidence, difficult as it is to look at, is not an equal partner in this much-needed examination of the painful histories behind American identity.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Shortly after the War she published her classic book Testament of Youth and moved gradually towards a position of Christian pacifism. It was during the Second World War that she published the two short books included in this volume, Seeds of Chaos and Humiliation with Honour. In them she argued the pacifist cause and as the horrors of the end of the Second World War became manifest (Dresden, Hiroshima) her books became increasingly well know and influential. It was in 1943 that Vera Brittain began work on these books, which she termed a 'final appeal' against saturation bombing. Hamburg 'surpassed them all in horror': On the night of 27-28 July 1943, several square miles of the residential and commercial heart of the city were engulfed in a firestorm which burned for several hours at a temperature of 1,000 degrees centigrade. This is the background out of which these powerful texts were inspired. </p><p>This edition includes an introduction by Aleksandra Bennett of McMaster University in Canada and a preface by Shirley Williams, Vera Brittain's daughter.</p></p><p>Vera Brittain (1894-1970) was a writer, journalist, pamphleteer and lecturer (on both sides of the Atlanic). Her novel Testament of Youth was an instant best seller. It was republished by Virago and made into a TV series.'Written with blazing and courageous sincerity at a time when such views were reviled by the prevailing militaristic powers-that-be.

To Alexander the Great, the country was a place of clever naked philosophers and massive armies mounted on elephants &#x2013; which eventually forced his army to retreat. To ancient Rome, it was a source of luxuries, mainly spices and textiles, paid for in gold&#x2015;hence the enormous numbers of Roman gold coins excavated in India. At the height of the Mughal empire in 1700, India boasted 24 percent of the world economy&#x2015;a share virtually equal to Europe&#x2019;s 25 percent. But then its economy declined. Colonial India was known for its extremes of wealth and poverty, epitomized by the Taj Mahal and famines, maharajas and untouchables, and also for its spirituality: many-armed Hindu gods and Buddhist philosophy, Mahatma Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore.<br><br><em>India: A Short History</em> places as much emphasis on individuals, ideas and cultures as on the rise and fall of kingdoms, political parties and economies.

Almost nothing pertaining to the life of Bob Marley is left out; the origins of Rastafarianism (the Ethiopian religion that was the keystone of his life), the roots of the reggae sound, the Jamaican political and social debacle that informed his lyrics--this is a comprehensive account of the life of the artist and the times that produced him.<p> <i>Catch a Fire</i> is assiduously researched; the details writer Timothy White presents of the King of Reggae's life are cinematic in scope and, at times, cumbersome. White includes much of his primary source material, ranging from full interviews with band members to unearthed CIA documents, and devotes a whole section to describing his exhaustive research process. The final product is rich with elements of spiritual tome, rock biography, and history text; it is a hagiographic epic--the story of a man and his legend. <i>--Brendan J.

She originally trained as a fine artist and has worked for a number of publishers illustrating in black and white and colour. Her most recent commission has been the major DK Bible. Geraldine McCaughrean&#39;s novels and retellings for children have won her the Carnegie Medal, the Guardian Children&#39;s Fiction Award, the Whitbread Award and the Beefeater Award. A prolific author who writes for all ages, she lives in Berkshire with her husband and young daughter Ailsa.Gr. 4^-7, younger for reading aloud. McCaughrean uses the voice of a storyteller to recount the Old Testament's history of God and His people. In conversational though not informal style, she tells of Adam and Eve, following with most of the important biblical tales--from Noah's Ark through Isaiah's prophecies of a messiah. She remains true to the King James text but develops and fleshes it out, offering explanations and tying together themes. She also brings out feelings and emotions as she imagines them, as in the story of God's demanding Abraham to sacrifice Isaac: "He laid his Isaac, his only son, the miracle of his old age, on the stony altar." A few references to events in the New Testament will make this a less than ecumenical purchase for libraries serving Jewish and Islamic populations--among them, a reference as Daniel emerges from the lion's den: "There was to be another cave, sealed with a stone and full of Death, from which God released a man alive." But the book will still have wide appeal, with the lively text made even more enticing by numerous watercolor illustrations depicting the people and events with historical accuracy, creativity, and tenderness. A great choice for reading aloud and one that ensures that children understand references to Jacob's ladder, Samson's hair, David and Goliath, and many of the other stories from the Old Testament that permeate our culture. <i>Susan Dove Lempke</i></p><h2>A Sea of Troubles (John Pearce, 9)</h2><p>1794.

I open my show with it because I know people are gonna request it until I sing it. I wrote it myself, nine verses, and it broke my heart when I had to cut three verses out because it was too long. I could have written a thousand more verses, I've got so many memories of Butcher Holler.<br><br>To me, that place is the most important part of my life. My fans and writers are always making a big deal about me acting natural, right from the country. That's because I come from Butcher Holler, Kentucky, and I ain't never forgot it.<br><br>I'm always making Butcher Holler sound like the most backward part of the United States&#x2014;and I think maybe it is. I've travelled all over this country, down South and out West, and I ain't never seen anything like it. And I ain't making fun of it, because I'm the most backward person you ever saw. I never knew where babies came from until it happened to me.<br><br>This might give you an idea of how backward we are, but first, to appreciate this story, you've go to know that in eastern Kentucky we saw the word "press" instead of "closet." Anyway, one of my best friends is Dr. John Turner, who took care of me when I was younger. <br><br>Doc swears he saw this patient standing in front of the hospital elevator, looking confused. Doc asked him what was the matter, and the patient said, "Doc, I just seen a nurse get into that press&#x2014;and when the door opened she was gone!" See, that patient live in a holler all his life and never saw an elevator before. Myself, I never rode in an automobile until I was twelve.<br><br>Holler people are just different from anybody else. They live high up in the hills, one day at a time. There's probably a few who don't know who the president is, and there have been times when they were better off that way. Maybe things are changing now, with television and better roads and stuff, but I've got relatives living up in Butcher Holler who have never been further than Paintsville, ten miles away, in their lives. They're really beautiful people in their own way. Everybody else is worrying about the energy crisis, and talking about getting back to the simple things. My people are already there. If we run out of energy, my relatives know how to patch their houses and grow gardens, so they're gonna have the last laugh on everybody.<br><br>Let me explain where Butcher Holler is. You take any place in the United States today, and they've got an interstate highway, right? Well, you get on one of them interstates and drive to Huntington, West Virginia, which is already pretty hilly country&#x2014;but you ain't seen nothing yet. You get off Interstate 64 and head south along Highway 23 into Kentucky. That's a good three-lane highway going past some nice farms and factories and mobile homes. You drive for about an hour and a half until you get to Paintsville, which has around 4,000 people.<br><br>Paintsville may not look too big to outsiders, but in Johnson County it's the biggest thing going. That's the first place I ever saw a toilet with running water, just before I got married. I went into the bus station to go to the bathroom, but when I sat down on the seat, the toilet flushed automatically. I got so scared I was gonna get flushed down, I ran out of there and waited until we found a good old outhouse.<br>When I was a little girl, my big city was Van Lear, which was five miles away, a coal camp for the Consolidated Coal Company, with rows of wooden houses they rented to the miners. There must have been 10,000 people living around Van Lear in the good times. The company had a post office and company stores where you paid for you things in scrip. If you went into debt, you owed your soul to the company store, just like the song says. The company also had a recreation hall where they showed movies. People make coal camps sound like slavery, but in a lot of ways it was the best thing ever happened to people&#x2014;as long as coal kept running.<br><br>Before I was born, Van Lear was a boom town. The company kept their houses painted. The foremen had nice homes up on Silk Stocking row, and the bosses had real beautiful homes. Off to one side was a row of houses called Nigger Holler where the black miners lived. They worked in the mines with the whites, but they had to live off by themselves. I'm sure there was prejudice in the coal camps, but my family grew up so high in the hollers, we never knew about it.<br><br>My Daddy was color-blind in two ways. About the only color he could see real good was yellow, and I have troubled telling red from orange myself. But we were also color-blind about people. It's like in 1972, when I was up for the award for Best Female Singer on national television, and Charley Pride was going to present the award. People warned me not to kiss Charley in case I won, because it would hurt my popularity with country fans. I heard that one girl singer got canceled Down South after giving a little peck to a black friend on television. Well, Charley Pride is one of my favorite people in country music, and I got so mad that when I won I made sure I gave him a big old hug and a kiss right on camera. You know what? Nobody canceled on me. If they had, fine, I'd have gone home to my babies and canned some string beans and the heck with them all.</p><h2>Under The Volcano</h2><p>One of the twentieth century&#39;s great undisputed masterpieces, Malcolm Lowry&#39;s Under the Volcano includes an introduction by Michael Schmidt in Penguin Modern Classics.It is the fiesta &#39;Day of the Dead&#39; in the small Mexican town of Quauhnahuac. In the shadow of the volcano, ragged children beg coins to buy skulls made of chocolate, ugly pariah dogs roam the streets and Geoffrey Firmin - ex-consul, ex-husband, an alcoholic and a ruined man - is living out the last day of his life. Drowning himself in mescal while his former wife and half-brother look on, powerless to help him, the consul has become an enduring tragic figure. As the day wears on, it becomes apparent that Geoffrey must die. It is his only escape from a world he cannot understand. His story, the image of one man&#39;s agonised journey towards Calvary, became a prophetic book for a whole generation.Malcolm Lowry (1909-1957) was born and died in England. Between school and studying English at St Catherine&#39;s College, Cambridge he spent five months at sea as a deckhand, an experience which gave him the material for his first novel, Ultramarine (1933). After marrying in Paris, he moved to New York where he completed In Ballast to the White (1936). Under The Volcano was begun in Hollywood, coloured by a short stay in the Mexico that it describes, and eventually finished in Dollarton, British Columbia.

On the most fateful day of the consul's life&#x2014;the Day of the Dead, 1938&#x2014;his wife, Yvonne, arrives in Quauhnahuac, inspired by a vision of life together away from Mexico and the circumstances that have driven their relationship to the brink of collapse. She is determined to rescue Firmin and their failing marriage, but her mission is further complicated by the presence of Hugh, the consul's half brother, and Jacques, a childhood friend. The events of this one significant day unfold against an unforgettable backdrop of a Mexico at once magical and diabolical.</p><p><em>Under the Volcano</em> remains one of literature's most powerful and lyrical statements on the human condition, and a brilliant portrayal of one man's constant struggle against the elemental forces that threaten to destroy him.</p>Malcolm Lowry (1909 - 1957) was raised in England and died there but lived much of his troubled life semi-nomadically - in New York, Mexico and British Columbia.</p><h2>Will Eisner&#39;s The Spirit: The Corpse-Makers</h2><p>A series of unexpected disappearances and deaths hit Central City.

He resides in Barrington, Rhode Island.PreSchool-Grade 2-Presenting the holiday from a child's point of view, the book begins the day before Thanksgiving with three poems set at school. A group of children dress as Native Americans, Pilgrims, and turkeys to provide a little historical background. Once home, preparations begin in earnest. The house and yard are tidied, family members start to arrive, and the cooking commences. Listening to grandma's stories, participating in a small-scale Thanksgiving parade, playing charades, and enjoying a good meal are all part of this family's celebration. Although the poems are primarily cheerful, a "Prayer for Others" is included as a reminder that not everyone will take part in such a plentiful feast. However, it is paired with "Thank You God for Bugs," which does detract somewhat from its serious message. Alley's illustrations make the book. Humorous touches abound, greatly enlivening the text. As the children prepare for the Thanksgiving play, their costumes are falling off, losing pieces, and tripping them up. Two birds on a branch seen through a window are adorned with an Indian headdress and a Pilgrim hat. As the play begins, the turkeys get tangled and a stray pumpkin flies off into the audience. The book ends on just the right note with a "Goodnight Prayer."

A detective whose success in tracking down criminals became a popular long-running radio program from 1937 to 1954, after beginning a number of years before as a ghost-like voice introducing a bone-chilling murder play that concluded with a sinister laugh. <br>The Shadow was originally the voice of conscience and it was through the fear he aroused in the minds of criminals that they exposed their own villainy or destroyed themselves. Never committing cold-blooded murder for the sake of justice, The Shadow suffered a harrowing existence of close calls and death-defying challenges. His exploits were many; a career paced by chase and gunplay. Werewolves, vampires, psychotic murderers, gangsters, mad scientists -- he battled them all. <br> Looking back on the program today, it is hard to decipher which was more fun -- The Shadow's methods at plaguing a guilty conscience or the variety of horrors and villains he fought against. <br>The program left an impression on adults who enjoyed reading the pulp magazines and on young children who listened to the chillers. Radio station KQW in San Jose, California, created its own radio advertisement to promote the station one depicting two children at play remarking, I don t want to be Napoleon any more I want to be The Shadow. <br>The Shadow was inspiration to many, famous or fan. In his autobiography, Isaac Asimov fondly recounted filching the exciting yarns of The Shadow pulps from his sleeping father and replacing the magazine before he woke. Dick Ayers, creator of the Ghost Rider for the comics, admitted there was a blending of enthusiasm in his interpretations of the Ghost Rider's speech, influenced not by the pulp magazines, but by having been an avid fan of the radio program. Scriptwriters for the radio program later recycled their Shadow plots for novels and short stories -- Alfred Bester recycled one of his Shadow plots into the 1952 novel The Demolished Man, which won him a Hugo Award in 1953. <br>This 800 page book documents the entire history of the long-running radio program, with rare never-before-seen photos, interviews with cast and crew, and a carefully organized presentation of the facts. Through extensive research of original radio scripts, newspapers on microfilm and various archives across the country, this book is sure to please both casual and devoted fans of The Shadow. An extensive episode guide with plot summaries and an index enhance the book's appeal.</p><p>Martin Grams is the author and co-author of more than 20 books about old time radio and retro television.

The dragon keepers and the fledgling dragons are forging a passage up the treacherous Rain Wild River. They are in search of the mythical Elderling city of Kelsingra, and are accompanied by the liveship Tarman, its captain, Leftrin, and a group of hunters who must search the forests for game with which to keep the dragons fed. With them are Alise, who has escaped her cold marriage to the cruel libertine Hest Finbok in order to continue her study of dragons, and Hest&#39;s amanuensis, Bingtown dandy, Sedric. Rivalries and romances are already threatening to disrupt the band of explorers: but external forces may prove to be even more dangerous. Chalcedean merchants are keen to lay hands on dragon blood and organs to turn them to medicines and profit. Their traitor has infiltrated the expeditionand will stop at nothing to obtain the coveted body parts. And then there are the Rain Wilds themselves: mysterious, unstable and ever perilous, its mighty river running with acid, its jungle impenetrable and its waterways uncharted. Will the expedition reach their destination unscathed? Does the city of Kelsingra even exist? Only one thing is certain: the journey will leave none of the dragons nor their human companions unchanged by the experience.</p><p><p>Fifteen dragons have set off on a dangerous trek up the Rain Wild River, in hopes of rediscovering their lost haven, the ancient city of Kelsingra. Accompanying them is a disparate group of rejects from Rain Wild society, including strong and defiant young Thymara; wealthy dragon scholar and Trader's wife Alise; and her companion, the urbane Sedric.

Edited by leading F1 journalist Alan Henry, it is long established as a genuine collector&#39;s item, and has an unrivalled heritage that is recognized by the entire motorsport community - and numbers F1 luminaries Jackie Stewart, Murray Walker and Ron Dennis as devotees. This sumptuous book has detailed race-by-race reports, vibrant features, comprehensive statistics and the best photography in the sport, supplied by James Moy and the CMG Photographic team.

The question is central to her debut novel, but Dean (Mo: A Woman's View of Watergate) doesn't let it sidetrack her from leading the reader on an amusing, sometimes pleasingly irreverent tour through Washington's halls of power. The three women suspected of dallying with Barry are married to men being tapped for his job and each is determined to help her husband win out. Sinclaire Ives, a generous once-and-future tart, grabs for the brass ring by starting rumors of a sex scandal involving a rival candidate. Thoroughly rude words are exchanged when that candidate's politely alcoholic wife, Caroline Riggs, hears of this perfidy, leaving the field to Jan Kirkland, the only spouse left with her own position in the administration, as well as a direct line to the president from her onetime CIA spook father. Dean's descriptions of the fight for glory on the disftaff side of the Washington power play are wryly sympathetic rather than bitchy, and most of her characters are engaging enough to follow suit. Though she stretches the bounds of credibility at times, it all adds up to an entertaining romp. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Rise of Modern Mythology, 1680-1860</h2><p><p>"... peerless...

Unlike much previous scholarship, this volume emphasizes the quotidian rather than the exceptional: the farm household seeking to preserve food or acquire tools, the surveyor balancing economic and technical considerations while laying out a turnpike, the woman of child-bearing age employing herbal contraceptives, and the neighbors of a polluted urban stream debating issues of property, odor, and health. These cases and others drawn from brewing, mining, farming, and woodworking enable the authors to address recent historiographic concerns, including the environmental aspects of technological change and the gendered nature of technical knowledge. Brooke Hindle's classic 1966 essay on early American technology is also reprinted, and his view of the field is reassessed. A bibliographical essay and summary of Hindle's bibliographic findings conclude the volume. The contributors are Judith A. McGaw, Robert C. Post, Susan E. Klepp, Michal McMahon, Patrick W.

Everybody in the South has heard about the eccentric millionaire mistress of Talisa, but Brooke has never met her. Josephine&#39;s cryptic note says she wants to discuss an important legal matter with Brooke, who is an attorney, but Brooke knows that Mrs. Warrick has long been a client of a prestigious Atlanta law firm. Over a few meetings, the ailing Josephine spins a tale of old friendships, secrets, betrayal and a long-unsolved murder. She tells Brooke she is hiring her for two reasons: to protect her island and legacy from those who would despoil her land, and secondly, to help her make amends with the heirs of the long dead women who were her closest friends, the girls of The High Tide Club - so named because of their youthful skinny dipping escapades - Millie, Ruth and Varina. Even at the end of her life, Josephine seems unwilling or unable to face her past, deliberately evading Brooke&#39;s questions. When Josephine dies with her secrets intact, Brooke is charged with contacting Josephine&#39;s friends&#39; descendants and bringing them together on Talisa for a reunion of women who&#39;ve actually never met. What follows is a tale of a romance thwarted, friendships renewed, justice delivered and true love found.

And what do we truly have in common with the Neanderthals?

For example, our big brains may have served to set our species apart and spur our societal development, but perhaps not in the ways we have often assumed. And it&#x2019;s possible that the Neanderthals, our infamous ancestors, were not the primitive beings portrayed by twentieth-century science.

Beginning in the upper room and then to Gethsemane and beyond, from betrayal and denial to mock trials, from the agony and victory of the cross to the ascension, the reader is compelled to see those momentous events through the eyes of the disciples, and more importantly, through the eyes of Christ Himself. Crowder&#39;s easy and personable style gives readers a fresh look at some of the most familiar texts in the Bible, while highlighting elements that are often overlooked.</p><p><p>The Path of His Passion</p> <p>Author Bill Crowder invites you to join him in tracing Christ's final hours and walking with Him on <i>The Path of H</i>is <i>Passion</i>--"the journey of seeking Him, considering Him, worshiping Him."</p> <p>Christ taught vital lessons to His disciples in those final hours leading up to the cross, and in those lessons has left principles for us to learn as well. Don't become so anxious to "survey the wondrous cross" that you overlook the importance of the events that happened on the way to it, says the author.</p> <p>The Last Supper and the upper room; His agony in the garden of Gethsemane; on trial before the high priest and Pilate; and on the Via Dolorosa, the route that took Him to Golgotha- at each point of Christ's journey, you will see Him as prophet, sufferer, advocate, and savior. And because the path does not end at the cross, you will also see Christ as He rises from the grave in triumph over death and in His exaltation as He ascends to His Father.</p> <p>Walk with Christ along <i>The Path of His Passion </i>and come to a greater appreciation for the journey He took for you. As the author draws out the valuable lessons Christ taught along the way, he will encourage you to be "more determined than ever to embrace the cross that Christ embraced for you."</p><p>Bill Crowder, who spent over twenty years in pastoral ministry, is vice president of ministry content at Our Daily Bread Ministries.

She was wilting in the heat that all the ladies had already remarked upon as being unseasonably warm for June. Susanna fluttered her fan and tried to take an interest in the conversation, but she didn't care about hats. She didn't care about garden parties. She didn't care about finding a husband. If her mother ever heard Susanna admit husband hunting was not her favorite pursuit, she would lock Susanna in her room for days.</p> <p>Susanna did not mind being locked in her room as much as her mother seemed to think. In her room, she could lose herself in her drawing. She could bring out her pencil or watercolors and sketch until her hand cramped. Sketching was infinitely preferable to spending hours embroidering in the drawing room, listening to her mother's lectures on decorum and etiquette.</p> <p>Susanna did not need to be told how to behave. She had been raised to be a perfectly proper young lady. She was the daughter of an earl. She knew what was expected of her.</p> <p>One: She must marry well.</p> <p>Two: She must at all times exhibit good ton.</p> <p>Three: She must be accomplished, beautiful, fashionable, and witty.</p> <p>That third expectation was daunting indeed.</p> <p>Susanna had spent two decades playing the perfect earl's daughter. She'd had little choice. If she rebelled, even minutely, her mother quickly put her back in her place. At the moment, Susanna wished her place were anywhere but here. She sympathized with her failed sketches, feeling as though it were she tossed in the hearth and browning in the fire. She burned slowly, torturously, gasping for her last breath.</p> <p>Could no one see she was dying inside? Around her, ladies smiled and laughed and sipped tea. Susanna would not survive much longer.</p> <p>And no one cared.</p> <p>Ladies of the ton were far too concerned with themselves-what were they speaking of now? Haberdashery?-to notice she was smothering under the weight of the heat, the endless cups of tea, the tinny politeness of the ladies' laughs, and the interminable talk of bonnets. If she were to sketch her life, she would draw a single horizontal line extending into forever.</p> <p>Susanna stifled the rising scream-afraid she might wail aloud for once, rather than shriek silently and endlessly. Before she could reconsider what she planned, she gained her feet. She wobbled, shaking with uncertainty and fear, but she must escape or go quietly mad.</p> <p>Lady Dane cut her a look as pointed as a sharpened blade. "Do sit down, Susanna."</p> <p>"E-excuse me," Susanna murmured.</p> <p>"What are you doing?"</p> <p>Susanna staggered under the weight of the stares from the half-dozen women in their circle. She had not thought it possible to feel any heavier, but the addition of the women's cool gazes on her made her back bow.</p> <p>"Excuse me. I need to find-"</p> <p>"Oh, do cease mumbling." Lady Dane sounded remarkably like a dog barking when she issued orders. "You know I hate it when you mumble."</p> <p>"I'm sorry. I need to-"</p> <p>"Go ahead, my dear," their hostess said. "One of the footmen will show you the way."</p> <p>Susanna's burst of freedom was short-lived. She'd no more than moved away from her chair when her mother rose to join her. Susanna choked back a small sob. There really was no escape.</p> <p>"Could you not at least wait until we had finished our conversation?" Lady Dane complained, as though Susanna's physical needs were the most inconvenient thing in the world.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, Mama."</p> <p>"Why don't you stay, Dorothea?" the marchioness asked. "Surely Lady Susanna can find her way to the retiring room by herself."</p> <p>Susanna's gaze locked on her mother's. Inside, she squirmed like one of the insects her brothers used to pin for their collections. Lady Dane would most certainly defy the marchioness. She would never let her disappointing daughter out of her sight.</p> <p>Susanna had one glimmer of hope. Her brother's scandalous marriage a few weeks ago had noticeably thinned the pile of invitations the Danes received. The family was not shunned exactly, but they had spent more nights at home than the debutante daughter of an earl should.</p> <p>Not that she minded.</p> <p>Her mother patted Susanna on the arm, the stinging pinch delivered under cover of affection.</p> <p>"Do not dawdle."</p> <p>Susanna need not be cut free twice. She practically ran for the house.</p> <p>"She is perfectly safe here." The marchioness's voice carried across the lawn. "I understand why you play the hawk. She must make a good match, and the sooner the better."</p> <p>The sooner she escaped this garden party, the better. Every group of ladies she passed bestowed snakelike smiles before raising their fans and whispering. Sometimes the whispers weren't even whispered.</p> <p>"Dane introduced a bill to establish a central police force! What next? Gendarmes?"</p> <p>A few steps more.</p> <p>"I heard her brother began a soup kitchen."</p> <p>Almost there.</p> <p>"St. Giles! Can you imagine?"</p> <p>Susanna ducked into the cool darkness of the town house and flattened herself against the wall. She closed her eyes, swiping at the stinging tears. Breathe, breathe. Free from the whispers-that-were-not-whispers and the stares and, best of all, her mother, she slouched in smug rebellion.</p> <p>"May I be of assistance, my lady?"</p> <p>Susanna's spine went rigid, and she opened her eyes. A footman bestowed a bemused smile on her. She imagined it was not every day a lady ran away from the marchioness's garden party and collapsed in relief.</p> <p>"The ladies' retiring room. Could you direct me?"</p> <p>"This way, Lady Susanna."</p> <p>She followed him through well-appointed though cold, impersonal rooms until she reached a small room filled with plants, several chairs, two small hand mirrors on stands, a pitcher of fresh water and basin, and screens for privacy. Susanna stepped inside and closed the door. Finally alone. She straightened her white muslin gown with the blue sash at the high waist. Her hat sported matching ribbons. She might have removed it if it would not have been so much trouble to pin in place again. At the basin, she splashed water into the bowl and dabbed at her face. One look in the mirror showed that her cheeks were flushed and her brown eyes too bright. She had the typical coloring of a strawberry blond, and her pale skin reddened easily.</p> <p>In the mirror, she spotted something move, and a woman in a large, elaborately plumed hat emerged from behind the screen. Susanna's heart sank.</p> <p>She willed the woman to return to the party quickly and leave her to her solitude. The screens provided a convenient shield.</p> <p>"You are Lady Susanna, are you not?"</p> <p>There would be no hiding. The urge to crumple into a ball on the floor almost overwhelmed her, but she was the daughter of an earl. Susanna pushed her shoulders back.</p> <p>"Yes, I am. I'm sorry. I don't believe we've met."</p> <p>The woman patted her perfect coiffure, which was tucked neatly under her hat, and poured water from the ewer over her hands. "I am Lady Winthorpe."</p> <p>"Oh."</p> <p>The countess's face brightened with amusement. "I see you have heard of me. Do not worry. All of my children have married." She bent, baring her teeth in the mirror and examining them closely. "I cannot tell you what a relief it is not to have to push them at every titled man or woman in Town. I imagine your poor mother is at her wits' end."</p> <p>Heat rushed into Susanna's face, and her cheeks reddened most unbecomingly. Dane's marriage was indeed scandalous, and because it was, no one mentioned it to her.</p> <p>"I..." Her tongue lay thick and clumsy in her mouth.</p> <p>"What came over the earl?" the countess asked, patting the yellow and white plumes of her hat, which matched her gown. "Why would he make such a poor match?"</p> <p>The countess turned to stare directly at Susanna.</p> <p>"Lady Elizabeth is the daughter of the Marquess of Lyndon." She'd said it so often it had become a chant.</p> <p>The countess flicked open her fan and wafted it. Painted on the fan was an image of a peacock with its feathers spread. "Lady Elizabeth was raised in a rookery as a thief. Even being the daughter of a marquess cannot redeem her."</p> <p>She would not shrink. Susanna forced iron into her spine. "My brother loves her. That is enough for me."</p> <p>"Love. How sweet."</p> <p>The fan snapped closed, and the countess tapped Susanna's arm with it. "What does your mother think of this profession of love?"</p> <p>"I-" Susanna had no idea. She'd never once heard her mother speak the word love, although she railed against her eldest son's m�salliance often enough.</p> <p>"She was in love once. Did she ever tell you that?"</p> <p>Susanna dared not open her mouth for fear she would only babble. Were they still speaking of the Dowager Countess of Dane? Surely, she had never been in love. Her mother did not know the meaning of the word. But perhaps Lady Winthorpe spoke of Susanna's late father. He had not exactly doted on his children either, especially not on her. But the countess might have mistaken the late earl's marriage for a love match.</p> <p>"My father and mother-"</p> <p>The countess waved the fan, narrowly missing Susanna's chin.</p> <p>"I do not refer to your mother's marriage. She married him for the title and the money, I imagine. Your mother is no fool. But there were days, in our youth, when I thought she might choose another course." The woman's blue eyes had become so unfocused as to look gray. "Handsome young beaux. Picnics in Hyde Park. Nights at Vauxhall Gardens. Long, dark nights." She winked at Susanna, and Susanna flinched with shock.</p> <p>The implication...or was it an insinuation...or an intimation...?</p> <p>The countess was not to be believed.</p> <p>"I don't know what you mean."</p> <p>"No, I see that you don't. In any case, your mother made her choice." The woman's eyes, blue again, narrowed.</p> <p>The countess stared at her so intently, Susanna actually took a step back.</p> <p>The countess tapped her chin with the edge of the fan. "I wonder..."</p> <p>Susanna held her breath, leaning forward to hear each and every syllable. All for naught. The woman didn't continue. The long silence, coupled with her curiosity, compelled Susanna to prompt Lady Winthorpe.</p> <p>"You wonder?"</p> <p>Voices rose and fell outside the door, and Susanna emitted a weak cry of protest. The door opened, revealing two young women speaking quietly to each other. One look at Susanna and their conversation ceased. The girls shared a look before they disappeared behind the screen and dissolved into giggles. Susanna toed the pale pink carpet with her slipper.</p> <p>"Good day to you," the countess said, opening the door and stepping out into the music room.</p> <p>Susanna stood rooted in place with the giggles behind her and questions swirling like dust motes in her mind. She should not pry further, but she was always doing as she ought. Her slipper dug into the rug, attacking the threads viciously. She caught the door before it could close all the way. The countess whirled when Susanna emerged behind her, and Susanna took advantage of the woman's surprise.</p> <p>"I cannot help but ask, my lady. What do you wonder?"</p> <p>"I think I had better not answer that." She spoke slowly, enunciating every word. Weighing each one against her tongue before speaking it. "Your mother would not thank me."</p> <p>And there was that look again-the pitiful look one gave a pinned insect.</p> <p>"But I see you, Lady Susanna, with that hair and that nose, and I do wonder." She sauntered across the music room. "Yes, I do."</p> <p>Susanna touched her hair and her nose. What of them? Did the countess mean to deliberately confuse her?</p> <p>Susanna crumpled onto the piano stool. She'd used every last ounce of bravery in the failed attempt to wheedle information. At this point, bravery hardly mattered. Chasing the countess was not an option, least of all because it would mean returning to the garden party.</p> <p>Neither did she wish to return to the retiring room.</p> <p>She wandered to a harp and plucked at one of the strings, feeling the thick wires vibrate through her gloves. She'd always wanted to play the harp, but her mother had not allowed her to learn. Sitting with the instrument between her legs was unseemly. Susanna plucked another string, enjoying the light, airy sound of it.</p> <p>What had the Countess of Winthorpe meant about her mother being in love? Had her mother fallen in love with a man before she met Susanna's father? A man her mother met at Hyde Park...no, not Hyde Park. Hyde Park was fashionable, the place to see and be seen. The sunny breezes of Hyde Park chased away any scandal.</p> <p>But dark, sensuous Vauxhall Gardens...</p> <p>Susanna had never been. Her mother would not permit it. Her brothers had undoubtedly visited, but Susanna did not possess their freedom.</p> <p>She should ask her mother what Lady Winthorpe meant. Her mother's reaction might provide some clue. Of course, her mother might also tell her it was none of her concern, but Susanna was twenty now and would certainly marry in the next year. Lady Dane might relish the opportunity to share stories of her own days as a young debutante.</p> <p>Susanna almost laughed aloud. Her mother relished nothing except ordering Susanna to sit still and stop slouching. Perhaps she might ask her new sister to take her. Marlowe had promised Susanna an adventure as the forfeit for losing a wager. Susanna would have dearly loved an adventure.</p> <p>Her mother would never allow it, of course. Proper girls did not run away on adventures. Sometimes Susanna was so weary of acting properly.</p> <p>The door of the music room swung open, and Lady Litton entered, shutting the door quickly behind her. She was a few years older than Susanna and had become betrothed after her first Season. She'd already given the viscount she'd married two healthy sons.</p> <p>Susanna rose, and the viscountess, sensing the movement, spun around.</p> <p>"Oh, it's you," she said with a dismissive wave. "Run back to your mama. She will be wanting you to laugh at her bon mots."</p> <p>"My mother does not make bon mots." Clearly the woman did not know Lady Dane.</p> <p>Even clearer was Susanna's mistake in speaking out. Lady Litton's dark eyebrows slashed together, and the ribbon of her pink lips thinned further.</p> <p>"That was not my point."</p> <p>No. Her point had been to encourage Susanna to run away. Undoubtedly, Lady Litton had a rendezvous with a friend or lover planned in this room. Though Susanna did not know who that could be, as this was a ladies' garden party. For a brief moment, Susanna wished she had simply run away.</p> <p>But then something made her square her shoulders. Perhaps it was the thought of adventure. Perhaps she was still locked in her fantasy of Vauxhall, still imagining she could be someone else on those dark walks.</p> <p>Someone brave and interesting and desirable.</p> <p>"Why don't you run back to your mama?" Susanna said, surprising herself when the words from her thoughts came out of her mouth.

An artist, the woman whose portrait he had painted, and her husband became a triangle that drew the lawyer deeper and deeper into their tangled web. Now, encountering the painting that triggered it all, the lawyer must reconcile his past and present selves; when he eventually locates the woman, he is forced to confront the truth of his love and the reality that his life has been irrevocably changed.&nbsp;<br><br>With <i>The Woman on the Stairs, </i>the internationally acclaimed author of <i>The Reader </i>delivers a powerful new novel about obsession, creativity, and love. Intricately crafted, poignant, and beguiling, this is Bernhard Schlink writing at his peak.</p><p><b>Bernhard Schlink </b>is the author of the internationally best-selling novel <i>The Reader. </i>He is a former judge and teaches public law and legal philosophy at Humboldt University of Berlin and at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in New York City.1<br>&nbsp;<br>Perhaps you will see the painting one day. Long lost, suddenly resurfaced&#x2014;all the museums will want to display it. By now, Karl Schwind is one of the most famous and expensive painters in the world. When he turned seventy, I saw him in every paper, on every channel. Still, I had to look a long time before I recognized the young man in the old.<br>&nbsp;<br>The painting, I recognized immediately. I walked into the last court of the Art Gallery and there it hung. It moved me as it had when I entered the parlour of Gundlach&#x2019;s villa, and saw it for the first time.<br>&nbsp;<br>A woman descends a staircase. The right foot lands on the lower tread, the left grazes the upper, but is on the verge of its next step. The woman is naked, her body pale; her hair is blonde, above and below; the crown of her head gleams with light. Nude, pale and blonde&#x2014;against a gray-green backdrop of blurred stairs and walls, the woman moves lightly, as if floating, towards the viewer. And yet her long legs, ample hips, and full breasts give her a sensual weight.<br>&nbsp;<br>I approached the painting slowly. I felt awkward, just as I had back then. Then, it was because the woman who, a day before, had sat in my office in jeans, blouse, and jacket approached me in the painting naked. Now I felt awkward because the painting brought up what happened back then, what I&#x2019;d gotten myself into, and what I had soon banished from memory.<br>&nbsp;<br> <i>Woman on Staircase,</i> the label read. The painting was on loan. I found the curator and asked him who had lent the painting. He said he couldn&#x2019;t disclose the name. I told him I knew the woman in the painting, and the owner of the painting, and that its ownership would likely be contested. He furrowed his brow, but again said he couldn&#x2019;t tell me the name.</p><h2>Hiroshima &amp; Nagasaki</h2><p>Written 36 years after the event, here is the definitive scientific report on the only experience to date with nuclear warfare.

According to Steven Gaines, the author of a spate of "untold" and "true" biographies of such glitterati as Calvin Klein, they're also--surprise!--a sandbox of scandal. <p> And who exactly has been stirring things up? Gaines centers the book on an eccentric cast of characters in Hamptons history: semicloseted gay men of fabulous wealth and Ralph Lauren taste, half-cracked Mayflower descendants going to seed, and those "Philistines," the nouveau riche, blemishing the scenery with their terrible taste. "The establishment can hold off the newcomers for only so long," explains the author. "There are always more of Them than Us." </p><p> Heavily researched, the book is painstakingly detailed and unapologetically voyeuristic, full of "nine-ounce chilled Baccarat crystal stem glasses," "Chippendale sofas upholstered in Scalamandr� silks," "Gucci loafers," and "fourteen-karat-gold wallpaper." It's a Champagne truffle: sinful, enticing, and pure froth at its center. <i>--Maria Dolan</i></p>It may seem unusual to write a book about real estate, but the thirty miles of oceanfront farmland in the Hamptons has been bought and sold, visited, fought over, and coveted by some of the most creative, powerful, eccentric, and wealthy people who ever lived. They range from corporate moguls, to rock stars, artists, pirates and witches. Steven Gaines is a Hamptons &#34;insider&#34; who shares luscious gossip about the lucky few who have dwelled at one time or another on this precious land. His straightforward performance is enhanced by a haunting piece of piano music heard intermittently. Gaines entertains listeners with stories about Steven Spielberg&#39;s property, Martha Stewart&#39;s vicious feud with her neighbor, Jackson Pollock&#39;s untimely death, the witch hunts, early Native American and settler clashes, and many other fascinating stories.

You can enjoy it even if you have no idea who the Duplass brothers are.&#x201d;&#x2014;Janet Maslin, <i>The New York Times </i>(17 Refreshing Books to Read This Summer)</b><br><br>Whether producing, writing, directing, or acting, the Duplass Brothers have made their mark in the world of independent film and television on the strength of their quirky and empathetic approach to storytelling. Now, for the first time, Mark and Jay take readers on a tour of their lifelong partnership in this unique memoir told in essays that share the secrets of their success, the joys and frustrations of intimate collaboration, and the lessons they&#x2019;ve learned the hard way.<br> &nbsp;<br> From a childhood spent wielding an oversized home video camera in the suburbs of New Orleans to their shared years at the University of Texas in early-nineties Austin, and from the breakthrough short they made on a three-dollar budget to the night their feature film <i>Baghead</i> became the center of a Sundance bidding war, Mark and Jay tell the story of a bond that&#x2019;s resilient, affectionate, mutually empowering, and only mildly dysfunctional. They are brutally honest about how their closeness sabotaged their youthful romantic relationships, about the jealousy each felt when the other stole the spotlight as an actor (Mark in <i>The League, </i>Jay in <i>Transparent</i>), and about the challenges they faced on the set of their HBO series <i>Togetherness</i>&#x2014;namely, too much togetherness.<br> &nbsp;<br> But <i>Like Brothers </i>is also a surprisingly practical road map to a rewarding creative partnership. Rather than split all their responsibilities fifty-fifty, the brothers learned to capitalize on each other&#x2019;s strengths. They&#x2019;re not afraid to call each other out, because they&#x2019;re also not afraid to compromise. Most relationships aren&#x2019;t&#x2014;and frankly <i>shouldn&#x2019;t</i> be&#x2014;as intense as Mark and Jay&#x2019;s, but their brand of trust, validation, and healthy disagreement has taken them far.<br> &nbsp;<br> Part coming-of-age memoir, part underdog story, and part insider account of succeeding in Hollywood on their own terms, <i>Like Brothers </i>is as openhearted and lovably offbeat as Mark and Jay themselves.<br><br><b>&#x201c;Wright.

I want to stay home and be there at all times with my kids. Read to them. Cook for and with them. Play board games.

Leadership for young kids who don&#x2019;t have positive role models. Give myself and everything I can to them. An innocent child needs a thoughtful role model, and even though I&#x2019;m not perfect, I am likely willing to give more than what I hear the average burned--out public high school teacher can give, so I should get my teacher&#x2019;s license and&nbsp;...<br><br>&#x201c;The world is hard enough. Who am I to think I can help and save anyone? I&#x2019;m just an average--intelligence person trying to get by. It&#x2019;s enough just to make my own way in the world. I should just go inside myself. Stop talking and start listening. Get small and find a small sliver of happiness in the world and hang on to it for dear&nbsp;...&#x201d;<br><br>You get the picture.<br><br>Do you ever feel this way? Hopefully not. And if you don&#x2019;t, feel free to skip to the next chapter.<br><br>But if you do&nbsp;... we want to say sorry. Sorry you feel conflicted like we do. That you are uncertain as to what the right path is in life. Sorry that you want so badly to be useful but also happy. To be inspired but also at peace. To make change but also just get by.<br><br>But we also want to say&nbsp;... CONGRATULATIONS! Because, in our opinion, you may just be part of a dying breed. There will be fewer and fewer of you, and because of that and so much more, you are truly special.<br><br>Here&#x2019;s our theory:<br><br>When our parents got married, it was a time when people mostly married young. And in many cases, they married without fully vetting whether they would be a good matrimonial fit. Let&#x2019;s face it, they often got married because their religion said &#x201c;no sex before marriage&#x201d; and they really just wanted to start humping and not go to hell for it. They got married because they were sexually attracted to each other. And that attraction was often a result of the &#x201c;opposites attract&#x201d; theory. So when we were made, we were made from very different individuals who came together mostly because they liked the way the other smelled, as opposed to any long--lasting traits that made for a sustainable partnership. Hence, the two different people inside of us.</p><h2>The Decline &amp; Fall of the Roman Empire</h2><p>Edward Gibbon's The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire is one of the world's great accomplishments in historical research and writing. It was published between 1776 and 1788 and, in its final form, comprised six volumes and almost half-a-million words. It is a work that is generally recognized, even 200 years later, to be--in style and in breadth of conception--perhaps the finest history ever written.<br><br>Gibbon divided his volumes equally among the three centuries of the Roman Empire, from Marcus Aurelius to the fall of the West, and the thousand years that followed to the capture of Constantinople. In this one-volume abridgment greater space is given to the first and, historically speaking, most valuable half of the period. The story of the decline and fall unfolds progressively through the exciting vicissitudes of history, through the evolution of absolute government from the Antonines to Diocletian and the Byzantine emperors, with the courts and hierarchies that anticipate modern Europe. Gibbon's famous treatment of Christianity is fairly represented. The abridgment draws as well on the most significant chapters of the second half of The Decline and Fall, and the book ends with the capture of Constantinople and the memorable picture of Rome itself in the Dawn of the Renaissance.<br><br>This volume was prepared by D. M. Low, a well-known Gibbon scholar and author of a notable biography of the historian. Low's skillful abridgment of Gibbon's work has introduced the masterpiece to successive generations of readers who, due to the great length of the original, might never have attempted to read through all six volumes. Low's effort succinctly presents the sweep of a broad and deeply significant era in history and captures quite effortlessly the power of Gibbon's brilliant writing.</p><p></p><h2>Pop-up Shakespeare</h2><p>Discover all of Shakespeare&#39;s thirty-nine magnificent plays in one spectacular pop-up book from Jennie Maizels and the world-renowned comedy theatre troupe, the Reduced Shakespeare Company (R).

In this precarious new era, three young women prepare themselves to head off to university and explore the world beyond Yorkshire, England. The bookish Hetty Fallowes struggles to become independent of her overbearing mother, Una Vane embarks on a bicycle trip around the countryside with a young man from the wrong side of the tracks, and Liselotte Klein, a Jewish refugee taken in by a Quaker family, heads to London in search of her only relatives to survive the Nazis.<br><br>As the three struggle to find meaning and love in a new world, they realize that they still have much to learn, and that their friendship is perhaps the only constant in an ever-changing world.</p><p>Jane Gardam has twice won the Whitbread Award, for <b>The Hollow Land</b>, and <b>Queen of the Tambourine</b>. She is also the author of <b>God on the Rocks</b>, which was short-listed for the Man Booker Prize, and most recently, <b>Faith Fox</b>.Here is a great vacation read but it's definitely not a throwaway. Prolific English novelist Gardam, Whitbread Award winner for both The Hollow Land and Queen of the Tambourine, has crafted a story through which readers can step into 1946 England. The war is over and the world is profoundly changed, though some of the old trappings remain, reminders of a faded past. Three Yorkshire girls of considerable intelligence but modest means have earned scholarships to universities in Cambridge and London; the novel is set during the summer before their departure for university. Hetty Fallowes decides "to be ruthless and positive and in charge of [her] own soul." She rebels against her quirky parents, especially her pious mother, who married her intellectual, grave-digging father for love and now regrets it. Plucky Una Vane's mother is using her dead father's office (he was a doctor) as a beauty parlor; Una develops leftist leanings and embarks on a romance with Ray, a boy of questionable background. Lieselotte Klein is a Jewish-German refugee who came to the village as a child to live with a Quaker family. At 17, she is suddenly sent to stay with a strange, elderly Jewish couple in London and finally, briefly, with distant relatives in California. All characters, major and minor, are superbly developed and convincing. The portrait of postwar England as conventions crumble and the country is rebuilt is terrific, drawn by a writer whose attention to detail recreates, lovingly and with bright flashes of wit, another time and place. (July)Forecast: Strong reviews and favorable word-of-mouth will be crucial to help build an American readership for this fine import.<p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Black Stiletto: Black &amp; White: A Novel (2)</h2><p>It&#39;s 1959, and Judy Cooper, the Black Stiletto, sets out to confront a dangerous gangster known as the heroin king of Harlem when the teenage daughter of her beloved martial arts instructor ends up a prisoner in an uptown narcotics den. The Stiletto has troubles of her own- a shady filmmaker is threatening to reveal her identity to the world- a close friend of her landlord and substitute father may be in cahoots with the Harlem criminals- she&#39;s fighting for racial equality- and she has fallen in love again- this time with an FBI agent who has standing orders to arrest her. Meanwhile the Stiletto&#39;s son faces his own blackmail crisis when he finds out that there is a second copy of an 8mm film he found in his mother&#39;s strongbox - showing the Black Stiletto unmasked in a film studio dressing room. As he tries to stop the filmmaker&#39;s son&#39;s extortion plot, he learns that his daughter, Gina, has been brutally assaulted in New York City. The past and the present meet.</p><p>Raymond Benson is the bestselling author of 28 published titles, including the first three novels in the Black Stiletto series: The Black Stiletto, The Black Stiletto: Black &amp; White, and The Black Stiletto: Stars &amp; Stripes.

In this cartoonish sequel set the next year, Judy takes on an established mob (Italian) and an emerging mob (Negro) with her fists, feet, and trademark stiletto while flirting with FBI agent John Richardson. In the present, Martin Talbot, Judy Cooper Talbot's son, discovers his aged mother's long-buried secrets as revealed in her diaries and an old 8-mm film. Tacking back and forth between the diaries and Talbot's dilemma when someone else produces the same film, Benson crafts dual dramas.

Haden Blackman preys on our more eccentric curiosities with his fact-filled <i>Field Guide to North American Monsters</i>. Even the monster-shy will find it hard not to smile when they read sidebars such as "What does bigfoot eat?" (Everything from acorns and honey to tadpoles and salmon.) Seriously and exhaustively researched, this guide covers more than 100 monsters in the following categories: hairy humanoids, lake monsters and sea serpents, flying monsters, dwarves and giants, cryptid animals (animals heretofore unknown to science), beastmen and beastwomen ("humanoids" with numerous animalistic features), supernatural monsters, and the not readily classifiable enigmatic entities such as the bogeymen, phantom felines, and the infamous Mad Gasser of Mattoon. <p> Gleaned from Native American legends, American folklore, and modern sightings, this is the first-ever collection cataloging the vast expanse of bizarre creatures inhabiting North America. Laid out like a field guide to birds or mammals, the book helps the reader become familiar with each monster through photos (when available), drawings, and each creature's vital statistics: distinguishing features, range and habitat, diet, the source reporting the monster, and a rating of the likelihood of spotting each creature in the wild. </p><p> An avid monsterologist, the author offers useful suggestions for pursuing this rare field of study, including advice for how to behave during a monster encounter and a thorough sample questionnaire to use when interviewing monster eyewitnesses. <i>--Kathryn True</i></p></p><h2>The Black Seraphim</h2><p>Young pathologist James Scotland handles the inquest into the murder of the archdeacon in the small cathedral town of Melchester</p><p>Born in Lincolnshire, England, Michael Francis Gilbert graduated in law from the University of London in 1937, shortly after which he first spent some time teaching at a prep-school which was followed by six years serving with the Royal Horse Artillery. During World War II he was captured following service in North Africa and Italy, and his prisoner-of-war experiences later leading to the writing of the acclaimed novel &#39;Death in Captivity&#39; in 1952.After the war, Gilbert worked as a solicitor in London, but his writing continued throughout his legal career and in addition to novels he wrote stage plays and scripts for radio and television. He is, however, best remembered for his novels, which have been described as witty and meticulously-plotted espionage and police procedural thrillers, but which exemplify realism.HRF Keating stated that &#39;Smallbone Deceased&#39; was amongst the 100 best crime and mystery books ever published. &#34;The plot,&#34; wrote Keating, &#34;is in every way as good as those of Agatha Christie at her best: as neatly dovetailed, as inherently complex yet retaining a decent credibility, and as full of cunningly-suggested red herrings.&#34; It featured Chief Inspector Hazlerigg, who went on to appear in later novels and short stories, and another series was built around Patrick Petrella, a London based police constable (later promoted) who was fluent in four languages and had a love for both poetry and fine wine. Other memorable characters around which Gilbert built stories included Calder and Behrens. They are elderly but quite amiable agents, who are nonetheless ruthless and prepared to take on tasks too much at the dirty end of the business for their younger colleagues. They are brought out of retirement periodically upon receiving a bank statement containing a code.Much of Michael Gilbert&#39;s writing was done on the train as he travelled from home to his office in London: &#34;I always take a latish train to work,&#34; he explained in 1980, &#34;and, of course, I go first class. I have no trouble in writing because I prepare a thorough synopsis beforehand.&#34;. After retirement from the law, however, he nevertheless continued and also reviewed for &#39;The Daily Telegraph&#39;, as well as editing &#39;The Oxford Book of Legal Anecdotes&#39;.Gilbert was appointed CBE in 1980. Generally regarded as &#39;one of the elder statesmen of the British crime writing fraternity, he was a founder-member of the British Crime Writers&#39; Association and in 1988 he was named a Grand Master by the Myst"Very well observed, splendidly plotted. " (<i>The Standard Times</i>)<br><br>"Michael Gilbert tells the story beautifully. " (<i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>"Grips like a bishops gaiters. " (<i>The Guardian</i>)<br><br>"Gilberts triumph is more than ingenious plot, character, atmosphere, and even witty observation. He brings a cultivated, questioning intelligence to his writing." (<i>The Instrumentalist</i>)<br><br>"As always, the author is wonderfully at home in these precincts and stocks his Barchester font judiciously with piranhas and red herrings." (<i>The Observer</i>)</p><h2>Art of the 20th Century</h2><p>From Klimt to Koons and everything in between: it&#39;s all here (TASCHEN&#39;s 25th anniversary special edition) Who could possibly have forecast on New Year&#39;s Eve 1899 that, one hundred years later, painting and sculpture would be only options, not prerequisites? The term &#34;&#34;art&#34;&#34; has been defined and redefined so many times over the last 100 years that it has gained entirely new social, political, and technological meanings. Ranging across the full spectrum of disciplines available, including photography and new media, and thematically chaptered to highlight relationships between works and movements, this readable and encyclopaedic masterwork does just what it says on the cover. Whether you want Surrealism or Land Art, Fluxus or Bauhaus, this is your be-all, end-all guide to art of the 20th century. An undertaking as immensely ambitious as this one deserves to be owned by everyone, which is why we decided to make a special, more compact edition of this two-volume classic in celebration of 25</p><p>This exhaustive look at a long century of art making and art questioning is, understandably, more broad than it is deep. A massive, boxed, two-volume set, it's divided into sections on painting, sculpture, new media (performance art, video art, earth art, etc.), and photography, with a 150-page biographical appendix of all of the 780 artists whose works are illustrated in the main sections of the book. The original German text, written by a team of writers and art historians, has been fluidly translated by John William Gabriel. The authors are very much of their own time and place: there are more works from after World War II than before it, and many more German artists--including mediocre and derivative ones--make the cut than if the book had been written by, say, an English or a French team. In fact, the English seem slightly shortchanged here. William Tucker, still a vital influence, is represented by a 1967 minimal sculpture and a four-word mention, and painter Howard Hodgkin is omitted entirely. And while American sculptor-entrepreneur Jeff Koons is given more than his due, the thoughtful and significant Rachel Whiteread is not mentioned at all. But <i>Art of the Twentieth Century</i> is an unquestionably useful reference guide to a period that swings dramatically from the impressionists all the way to Nam June Paik.Ingo F. Walther was born in Berlin and studied medieval studies, literature, and art history in Frankfurt am Main and Munich. He has published numerous books on the art of the Middle Ages and of the 19th and 20th centuries, including TASCHEN&#39;s Vincent van Gogh, Pablo Picasso, and Codices illustres.</p><h2>Robert the Bruce: A Tale of the Guardians (Guardians Trilogy)</h2><p><p>From author Jack Whyte comes the true story of Robert the Bruce: a passionate man. An incredible warrior. And one of Scotland's finest. </p><p>Robert I, or as he is known to a grateful Scottish nation, Robert the Bruce, was one of Scotland's greatest kings, as well as one of the most famous warriors of his generation. He spearheaded the valiant Scots in their quest for freedom, leading his people during the Wars of Scottish Independence against the Kingdom of England during the middle ages. His reign saw the recognition of Scotland as an independent nation, and today Bruce is remembered in Scotland as a national hero.</p><p>It was by no means a fair and easy road for this indomitable fighter. As a young man he saw the English king Edward I award the vacant Crown of Scotland to John Balliol. The nation quickly splintered into factions and this spurred Robert and his father to at first side with Edward and then against John, whom many of the nobles did not feel was the correct person to guide the nation. Thus began a decades-long path for Scottish freedom. To achieve this goal, Robert sometimes had to delicately balance the power of the nobles against the might of the English. He was a tireless campaigner and after a full life of battle and diplomacy, in May 1328, King Edward III signed the Treaty of Edinburgh-Northampton, which recognized Scotland as an independent kingdom and Bruce as its king.</p></p><p><p>JACK WHYTE was born and raised in Scotland and has lived in Canada since 1967. He has been an actor, orator, singer, and poet at various stages of his life, and was awarded an honorary doctorate of letters for his contribution to Canadian popular fiction. Whyte is the author of the internationally bestselling Dream of Eagles series and the Templar trilogy. He lives in Kelowna, British Columbia.</p>The second volume in Whyte&#x2019;s Guardians series is a bold, brash tribute to Robert the Bruce, one of medieval Scotland&#x2019;s fiercest warriors and its most revered king. Following the formula he established in The Forest Laird, his fictional biography of William Wallace, Whyte traces Robert&#x2019;s childhood, adolescence, and eventual evolution into a stalwart leader and champion of Scottish independence. As Edward I of England continues his quest to transform his unwilling neighbor to the north into his personal fiefdom, Robert develops the military and political skills necessary in order to lead a rebellion and liberate his beloved nation. All roads in this series can and must lead to the bloody Battle of Bannockburn as Whyte introduces James Douglas, setting the stage for the next installment in this series.

Reprint.</p><p>It's not every day that a fellow decides to pack in a good job, pack up his saddlebags, and set off by bicycle to make a circumferential journey around Australia. In 1996, that's just what American-born <i>Time</i> magazine correspondent Roff Martin Smith did, though; as he explains, he'd been living in Australia for 14 years but didn't really know the country, and he "felt no emotional bond to it." About to turn 38, a few pounds over his ideal weight, and untested as a distance bicyclist, Smith faced up to considerable odds, but he survived to tell the tale.<p> And a rollicking tale it is, as Smith meets with an odd assortment of humans and critters along his sometimes torturous path. (One all-too-long stretch of road, for instance, he calls "the most dangerous and frightening I've ever had the misfortune to ride: a suicide run of hammering trucks, heavy construction, muddy detours, and lane closures.") Smith logs time in crocodile country, too, in the far northern Australian rainforest, where he counts the awful moments until antediluvian doom strikes. It never does, and in any event the crocs are nothing compared to the errant sheep, emus, kangaroos, and death adders he encounters, to say nothing of the 108-degree gusts euphemistically referred to by local weathercasters as "sea breezes"--none of which poses quite the dangers that his fellow humans offer out on the beery highways of Oz. Difficult though the journey is, Smith keeps up his good cheer throughout these lively pages, and, if he's not quite unflappable, he's certainly a sympathetic narrator.</p><p> Expanded from his popular three-part series in <i>National Geographic</i> magazine, Smith's pedal-powered epic is an instructive manual for anyone contemplating a life-changing journey--and, for the rest of us, a highly enjoyable, altogether unexpected tour of the outback. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Smith relates the story of his bicycle trek through Australia in this amazing travel account. The New Englander, who has lived in Australia for the past 15 years, had never taken the time to see the country and realized he had no feel for the nature and character of Australia. Restless, he impulsively quit his prestigious job to embark on this journey. His adventure takes him through cities, mountains, deserts, and incredibly remote outback villages. Pitting himself against nature's harshest elements, Smith battles steep hills, headwinds, 140-degree heat, tropical storms, and xenophobia with a strength of purpose that rarely falters. Along the way, he crosses paths with a number of hostile and unsavory characters, but it is the surprising kindness and generosity of most of the people that touch him the most and teach him what it means to be "Australian." Smith set out as a foreigner, but he returned with a new and profound understanding and appreciation of that beautiful country and its people. The story of Smith's initiation into his adopted culture proves to be an engaging read. <i>Gavin Quinn</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

This brutally violent neo-Nazi organization dreamed of carving an isolated homeland out of the American northwest&#x2013;a dream they would finance by robbery, intimidation, and murder. For years, the FBI had sought to infiltrate the<b> </b>Aryan Nations, only to be thwarted by the group&#x2019;s extreme paranoia of new members.<br><br>Enter Dave Hall, a tattooed, 350-pound, six-foot-four former biker. A black belt in martial arts, he could fight, drink, and ride with the best&#x2013;which is to say, the worst&#x2013;of them. But Hall was no stereotypical biker. A thoughtful, articulate man blessed with a photographic memory and an unshakeable core of decency, Hall was looking for a new direction in life. After Hall was arrested for his minor<b> </b>involvement in a drug deal, FBI<b> </b>special agent Tym Burkey gave him a choice: go to jail or become an informant. Hall didn&#x2019;t go to jail.<br><br>So began a most unlikely partnership, between a hell-raising former biker<b> </b>and a by-the-book FBI man. The oddest of odd couples, they would slowly forge a unique friendship based on trust and support&#x2013;a friendship that Hall especially would come to value in the months and years ahead.<br><br>For what was supposed to be a short-term assignment grew to something much longer, and bigger in scope, as Hall became the Ohio Aryan Nations leader&#x2019;s right hand man. And more and more, Hall suspected that a significant terrorist action was being planned, something on the order of the Oklahoma City bombing.<br><br>Yet with the clock ticking, Hall found his hold on reality crumbling as he was forced into behaviors and beliefs that repelled him. With the ever-present threat of discovery and death hanging over his head, he felt his psyche start to fragment, leading to estrangement from his family and friends, and vicious bouts of insomnia, night terrors, and panic attacks. But it was too late to back out. Together, Hall and Burkey would have to finish their dance with the Devil. <br><br>Harrowing and intense, this true-life thriller is a testament to bravery, dedication, and friendship&#x2013;and a timely reminder that America&#x2019;s homegrown terrorists can be just as deadly as those from overseas.</p><p><b>Dave Hall</b> was born in the hills of southeastern Kentucky, the second of eleven children.

By now, I pretty much knew that stuff by heart. But this time I was wrong. This time, he removed a .45-caliber automatic pistol from where he&#x2019;d stuck it in his belt. He looked it over, popped out the clip, and took a bullet from the chamber then placed the gun on the table. I waited for more, but he wasn&#x2019;t talking. His dark eyes were on the bullet.<br><br>Attempting to lighten the mood, I asked, &#x201c;Got yourself a new weapon, Pastor?&#x201d;<br><br>He looked at me. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said calmly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve had this for a while now.&#x201d;<br><br>He picked up an ammo box and dumped some cartridges onto the table. I wondered what the hell he was up to, but I dared not show he made me nervous. Ever since I&#x2019;d met the man, one of the most ambitious figures in the Aryan Nations, I&#x2019;d been on high alert. He was both the smartest man I&#x2019;d ever encountered and the craziest.<br><br>Ray selected a cartridge and looked it over, as if to assess its weight or shine. Then with deliberation, he slipped it into the clip and said, &#x201c;You know, Brother Dave, we&#x2019;ve got to be very careful about informants.&#x201d;<br><br>I nodded. &#x201c;I agree.&#x201d;<br><br>He looked down at the gun that lay on the table between us, even as he continued to make comments that I could hardly hear. Blood was pumping in my ears, and though the heat was off, the room was warming up. I tried to shift as if trying to keep warm in the chilly air, but the Ohio winter didn&#x2019;t get to Ray. He seemed not to even notice how cold it was.<br><br>Picking up the bullets one by one, he continued to place them back into the clip until they were all nestled together. Clearly, he had something in mind. This was a man who had already tried to kill a cop, shooting him several times over a traffic stop, and I&#x2019;d heard him repeatedly threaten to kill others.<br><br>&#x201c;Brother Dave,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;what do you think we ought to do about informants?&#x201d;<br><br>Okay, I knew something was up, and I knew I might not get out of here alive. I had a sudden instinct to grab my side of the table, lift it, and turn it over on him, to crush him beneath it. But somehow I kept my wits about me. If I were just another member of the Aryan Nations, as I&#x2019;d been pretending to be for the past two years, I&#x2019;d be assertive on this topic, ready to act. I had to keep that in mind.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; I said with a shrug. &#x201c;I think you ought to take &#x2019;em out and shoot &#x2019;em.&#x201d;<br><br>Pastor Ray seemed to like that response, because he smiled a little, but I couldn&#x2019;t really tell if he believed my act. I&#x2019;d been wondering that each day since I&#x2019;d started this assignment. Sometimes he seemed to trust me; other times I wasn&#x2019;t so sure. I watched as he put the clip into the pistol, making it lethal, and cocked it. Then he laid the pistol back down on the table, putting his finger on the trigger and pointing the eye of the barrel directly at my chest. I tried not to swallow.<br><br>He nodded a little, as if affirming something for himself. &#x201c;What do you think we really should do about informants?&#x201d;<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t know if he wanted an answer or was just trying to scare me, so I acted like I was now ready to get serious. &#x201c;Well, for one thing,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;I think we ought to really make sure that they&#x2019;re informants. If we find out they are, we ought to tell them that they&#x2019;re dismissed from the Aryan Nations, they&#x2019;re never allowed back at the church again, and then point them toward the door and make them leave. And when they turn to walk out, shoot &#x2019;em in the back of the head.&#x201d;<br><br>I waited.<br><br>Ray smiled. Then he slowly lowered the hammer on the pistol. In his typical way, he acted as if everything was normal. Looking straight at me, he asked, &#x201c;D&#x2019;you mind giving me a ride over to Kale Kelly&#x2019;s place?&#x201d;<br><br>I followed right along as if this had been an everyday conversation. &#x201c;Not at all,&#x201d; I responded as my insides slowly unclenched. I wasn&#x2019;t going to die today.<br><br>Ray got up, stuck the pistol back under his belt, and said, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go, Brother.&#x201d;<br><br>When I stood to follow him, I felt a little dizzy, like all my blood had drained out through my feet. But by the time we got to the car, I had recovered: I was fighting off the urge to snap the good pastor&#x2019;s neck.<br><br>It had been such a simple test, seemingly easy to pass, but I knew my life had hung in the balance. I couldn&#x2019;t have known for sure what was the right or wrong thing to say, but apparently I&#x2019;d satisfied him.<br><br>Later that night, when I was by myself, I finally got truly nervous. Pastor Ray Redfeairn was an unpredictable maniac with a hair-trigger temper. He acted first and thought about it later&#x2014;if at all. He seemed to feel no remorse. He watched me so closely I could just about feel his eyes on me, and I began to wonder, not for the first time, why I was even in this situation.<br>2.<br><br>First Encounter<br><br>Tym Burkey<br><br>Dave Hall&#x2019;s involvement with one of the most dangerous men I&#x2019;d ever investigated was due largely to me.<br><br>I&#x2019;ve been an FBI special agent since June 1991, but it had taken real effort to actually get in. My path was indirect. I&#x2019;d received a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in construction engineering from the University of Akron, in 1983 and was working for the city Engineering Department in Wooster, Ohio, where I grew up. I wanted to find a new line of work, but in 1984 I&#x2019;d married my wife, Anne, so I had little room to experiment. My sister-in-law provided media training at the FBI&#x2019;s academy, and she encouraged me to look into employment there. I took the entrance exam but did not qualify. I would have put it behind me, but after getting an MBA, I decided to try again. It turned out that at that time, the FBI was facing the savings and loan scandals and was eager to sign up people with a business background. This time I passed and they accepted me. Although Anne was expecting our third child, she urged me to go to the training.<br><br>After I completed the program at the Academy, I was assigned to the Dayton Resident Agency (DRA), an FBI satellite office out of the Cincinnati Division, which put me in southern Ohio, a hotbed of militant groups. But in the early nineties, I was working on crimes such as bank robberies, truck hijackings, and drugs.<br><br>On April 19, 1995, the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, was bombed. One hundred sixty-eight men, women, and children were killed and hundreds more were injured in the bombing. An alert highway patrol officer arrested Timothy McVeigh on his way out of town, and thanks to McVeigh&#x2019;s stated agenda we learned that a new type of terrorist had emerged in our homeland and that there were many groups around the country preparing for similar acts.<br><br>McVeigh espoused white supremacist rhetoric and supposedly envisioned himself avenging the 1993 standoff between the FBI and the Branch Davidians at Waco, Texas, which resulted in a conflagration at the Branch Davidian compound. Four agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) died there, as did more than eighty members of David Koresh&#x2019;s community. McVeigh&#x2019;s anger may also have been fueled by a book called The Turner Diaries, a piece of apocalyptic hate literature written by William L. Pierce under the pseudonym Andrew MacDonald and published in 1978. Approximately eighty thousand words long, it features a racist white &#x201c;hero,&#x201d; Earl Turner, who joins an underground movement that in the early 1990s resists the so-called Jewish conspiracy that has taken over the American government and confiscated everyone&#x2019;s guns. The book graphically depicts the subsequent extermination of Jews, blacks, Hispanics, other &#x201c;mud faces,&#x201d; and white &#x201c;race traitors.&#x201d; Turner&#x2019;s purpose was to establish an all-white separatist homeland in the Northwest.<br><br>The book is so full of hate it was hard for me to stomach it. I read it only on company time, not my time, while I was on a stakeout. I would never have read something like that by choice. A particularly disturbing part for me was the fictional bombing of the J. Edgar Hoover Building in Washington, D.C., which of course houses FBI headquarters. If I needed convincing that groups that embraced the Diaries viewed us as the enemy, this did it for me.<br><br>Pierce, the Diaries author, founded the National Alliance (NA), a white supremacist organization in Hillsboro, West Virginia, around the same time that Richard Butler formed the Aryan Nations (AN). The main differences between the NA and the AN were the level of violence and the religious angle. The AN openly preached from the Bible and used it to justify violence, whereas the agnostic NA advocated violence as a means to an end.<br><br>Timothy McVeigh apparently bought into The Turner Diaries&#x2019; racist paranoia, because one passage describes using a fertilizer bomb consisting of ammonium nitrate and fuel oil to blow up a federal building. McVeigh&#x2019;s destructive act would prove inspiring for other antigovernment groups, and the Diaries was often found in the homes or possession of members of these groups.<br><br>We knew that the central AN headquarters was a compound in Hayden Lake, Idaho, and we knew that its membership hoped for a militant uprising. There was an AN church in our jurisdiction, so we kept an eye on it, especially after McVeigh&#x2019;s attack. As the AN grew in power, the FBI was shifting its focus to prepare for more acts of domestic terrorism, which filtered down to local units that had direct contact with such groups. It was around this time that I met Dave Hall.<br>Dave Hall<br><br>In July 1996, I&#x2019;d agreed to help out a f...</p><h2>Just in Time!

Laura Thompson has put together a portrait of a courageous and contradictory woman&#x2014;a woman who expressed anti-feminist views while living a life of financial and emotional independence; a woman who appeared quintessentially English but who was only wholly able to be herself once she moved to France; a woman who believed implacably that the best response to life's pain was laughter. Approaching her subject with wit, perspicacity, and huge affection, Laura Thompson, like Mitford, makes her serious points lightly. Eschewing cliches about the eccentricities of the Mitford clan, Thompson analyzes the contradictions and complexities at the heart of Nancy Mitford's life and work.</p><p>A writer and freelance journalist, Laura Thompson won the Somerset Maughan award for her first book, THE DOGS (Chatto, 1994).

The peninsula contained the community of Charlestown, with its four hundred homes and some two hundred shops, warehouses, barns, and churches, plus three very high and large grassy hills, Bunker, the highest, Breed's, and Morton's. American troops had fortified Bunker and Breed's hills with earthworks, wooden fencing, and six cannon on the previous evening. General Thomas Gage, the commanding general in British-occupied Boston, was determined to clear the wide knolls to prevent the rebels from maintaining an elevated location where they would shell his army in the city or his ships in the harbor. An artillery pounding was to be followed by an afternoon attack of more than fifteen hundred troops. <br><br>Just after 1:30 p.m., a small navy of twenty-eight wide barges, each filled with more than forty armed British soldiers, and one transporting the man in charge of the operation, General William Howe, and his staff began to make its way across the harbor from Boston toward Morton's Point. As the ships moved through the water, the eyes of the men on board focused on Breed's and Bunker Hills. <br> <br>At just over six feet tall, physically well-proportioned and able to remain calm under fire, the affable Howe cut an impressive military figure. He and his men landed and quickly realized that their cannon had the wrong-sized cannonballs and were inoperable. Howe sent the boats back for reinforcements and usable ammunition while the British navy and land artillery fired shells into Charlestown. The shells hit several of the wooden residences there, igniting small fires whose thick smoke drifted throughout the area. One shell hit a church steeple, setting it on fire, and it soon toppled into the street. <br><br>The British assault on the two hills was viewed by one of the largest audiences of civilians to witness any battle during the American Revolution. The British artillery had opened up earlier that morning and the cannonading awakened everyone. Hundreds of residents in Charlestown climbed to the tops of their homes and raced out into nearby streets and meadows to watch the fighting on the hills. In Boston, several thousand people stood on the roofs of their houses for a good view. Some climbed to the tops of churches. Hundreds more packed the wharves near the water where the view was clearer. <br>Somehow, it was Breed's Hill, a lower and less defensible knoll than Bunker, that the majority of the Americans wound up fortifying that day as the British continually shelled the area. The top of the hill was so elevated that the men there could see all of Boston's dozen or so church steeples. They could also look down on the mill pond, the north battery full of British cannon, Hudson's Point, and, barely, John Hancock's commercial shipping wharf, plus the tops of the masts of ships moored at the Long Wharf, on the other side of town. The provincial forces were led by General Israel Putnam, a veteran of the French and Indian War, and Colonel William Prescott. It was Prescott, the tall commander with the muscular build, developed from nearly twenty years of farming, who made most of the decisions. The esteemed Dr. Joseph Warren, sixty-nine, head of the Massachusetts Provincial Congress, had joined them as a volunteer in a rash burst of patriotism applauded by all. <br><br>Wrote James Thacher, a local doctor who was an eyewitness, "[The British] immediately commenced a tremendous cannonade from their shipping, their floating batteries, and from all their fortifications. Bombs and shot were incessantly rolling among the provincials during the forenoon 'til the Royal Grenadiers and light infantry could be prepared to make their formidable attack."1 Private Peter Brown, a company clerk in Prescott's Massachusetts regiment, had fought at Concord. He watched the sea of Redcoats in their immaculate uniforms swarm off the barges and prepare for the attack. It was an awesome sight. Brown wrote that the British had so many men that they appeared ready to surround the provincials. "They advanced toward us in order to swallow us up. But they found a choky mouthful of us, though we could do nothing with our small arms as yet for distance and had but two cannon and nary a gunner. And they from Boston and from the ships a firing and throwing bombs, keeping us down 'til they got almost round us."<br><br>Howe ordered his men to march slowly in the direction of the newly dug breastworks on Breed's Hill. He sent the Royal Welch Fusiliers on a trot across a beach near the rear of the hill, toward a low stone wall and wood fence below the breastworks that seemed lightly defended because there was no firing coming from it. <br><br>Howe and his officers did not realize that Colonel John Stark and others had instructed their men behind the wall to withhold their fire until the Redcoats were close enough to hit with some accuracy. They were also instructed to shoot the officers to cause confusion and prevent orders from being heard. <br><br>When the intimidating Fusiliers, four abreast, bayonets fixed, trotted within fifty yards of the wall, the Americans opened up. The sound of the volley-it seemed that every musket was fired at once-could be heard throughout Boston. <br><br>The fury and force of the gunfire stunned the British. Stark had been right. At that close distance the muskets were lethal. Officers were hit and went down. The first line of men, instead of continuing up the slope toward the Americans, halted and tried to exchange fire with their muskets; this caused the second line to walk right into them. They were all easy targets for the Americans. Some of the British soldiers pitched forward, dead, and the men next to them fell backwards, musket balls lodged in their heads and chests, blood spurting everywhere. Those behind and around them were hit and killed or wounded and went down. Screams filled the air. Howe's vision of one single charge to drive the Americans off the hill and back to Charlestown evaporated in a roar of muskets, the air filled with the flames of the guns discharging and a rising cloud of smoke. Howe's own trousers were splattered with the blood of his men. <br> <br>On the southern side of the hill, a similar outcome occurred as the Americans unleashed a thunderous musket volley that cut into the British army approaching the earthworks and the redoubt, a wooden wall that protected them. The British were decimated. Their regulars were not only easy targets, but Howe had so many of them, 1,550, and they were positioned so close together, that musket balls missing one soldier hit the man next to him or behind him. <br><br>The British were also advancing through grass that hid large rocks and deep holes. Soldiers tripped on the impediments and fell, sometimes bringing down those near them. Others tripped over their bodies as they tumbled. Their formations came apart in minutes and their legendary ability to maneuver on the battlefield was thwarted. As they tried to stand or help each other, they were hit with yet another volley of fire from the provincials behind the breastworks on top of Breed's Hill. Orders shouted by the English army officers were drowned out by the screaming of the wounded lying in the grass, the triumphant shouts of the rebels and the sounds of the muskets. Blood flew everywhere in the hot afternoon air and the British, shaken, retreated back down the hill.</p><h2>A5/05: Lufthansa and Graphic Design: Visual History of an Airplane</h2><p>Deutsche Lufthansa is one of the most important airlines in the world, with a long and diverse history that goes back to 1926. The visual identity of Lufthansa is just as long and diverse. The beginning of the 1960s saw one of the most important steps in the development of corporate communication. The company employed the designer Otl Aicher and his Gruppe E5 student group to develop a visual identity for Lufthansa. It was substantially realized in 1963 and up until the present day counts as one of the most groundbreaking corporate design solutions of the 20th century. With a focus on the famous brand identity, the design and advertising history of Deutsche Lufthansa from the 1920s to today is comprehensively documented here for the first time. This volume contains numerous illustrations from the corporate archive and background articles and interviews.</p><p>With a focus on the famous brand identity, the design and advertising history of Deutsche Lufthansa from the 1920s to today is comprehensively documented here for the first time.Jens Muller and Karen Weiland studied in Communication Design at Fachhochschule Dusseldorf, Germany.</p><h2>Exploring the Titanic</h2><p>A best-selling, award-winning history of the Titanic disaster and discovery is presented in a hardcover edition and combines informative photographs and paintings with &#34;you are there&#34; text.</p><p>Robert D. Ballard is a former United States Navy officer and a professor of oceanography at the University of Rhode Island who is most noted for his work in maritime archaeology. He discovered the sunken Titanic and Bismarck ships and is the author of many books about his discoveries, including The Discovery of the Titanic, Finding the Titanic, and Graveyards of the Pacific. He lives in Mystic, Connecticut.Grade 4-8 In straightforward prose, complemented by excellent illustrations, the story of the Titanic 's first and final voyage as well as that of her rediscovery and exploration is told. The text captures the drama of both the night of the sinking as well as that of the discovery of the great ship on the ocean floor. The technically accurate and lucid explanations are greatly enhanced by Marschall's stunning paintings, as well as by diagrams and current and period photographs. Giving a wealth of detail on both the Titanic 's sinking and the exploration of the wreck 74 years later, this is the title of choice for both report writing and browsing on this topic. Although the glossary is good, it does not cover all unfamiliar words. ``Funnel,'' for example, is not defined and may confuse readers who do not realize that this refers to the smokestack. This is a minor quibble, however, given the general excellence of the work. Exploring the Titanic gives more depth of coverage in better style than does John Dudman's The Sinking of the Titanic (Bookwright, 1988), and is more colorful and compelling than Frank Sloan's Titanic (Watts, 1987).

On one of his rescue forays into no-man&#x2019;s-land, Joseph finds the body of an arrogant war correspondent, Eldon Prentice. A nephew of the respected General Owen Cullingford, Prentice was despised for his prying attempts to elicit facts that would turn public opinion against the war. Most troublesome to Joseph, Prentice has been killed not by German fire but, apparently, by one of his own compatriots. What Englishman hated Prentice enough to kill him?

Anne Perry lives in Scotland.CHAPTER ONE<br><br>It was shortly after three in the afternoon. Joseph Reavley was half asleep in the April sun, his back to the pale clay wall of the trench, when he heard the angry voices.<br><br>&#x201c;They be moi boots, Tucky Nunn, an&#x2019; you know that well as Oi do! Yours be over there wi&#x2019; holes in &#x2019;em!&#x201d; It was Plugger Arnold, a seasoned soldier of twenty, big-boned, a son of the village blacksmith. He had been in Flanders since the outbreak of war in August. Although he was angry, he kept his voice low. He knew it carried in the afternoon stillness when the men snatched the three or four hours of sleep they could.<br><br>The German trenches were only seventy yards away across this stretch of the Ypres Salient. Anyone foolish enough to reach a hand up above the parapet would be likely to get it shot. The snipers seldom needed a second chance. Added to which, getting yourself injured on purpose was a court-martial offense.<br><br>Tucky Nunn, nineteen and new this far forward, was standing on the duckboards that floored the trench. They were there to keep the men&#x2019;s feet above the icy water that sloshed around, but they seldom worked. The water level was too high. Every time you thought it was drying out at last, it rained again.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah?&#x201d; Tucky said, his eyebrows raised. &#x201c;Fit me perfect, they do. Didn&#x2019;t see your name on &#x2019;em. Must &#x2019;ave wore off.&#x201d; He grinned, making no move to bend and unlace the offending boots and hand them back.<br><br>Plugger was sitting half sideways on the fire-step. A few yards away the sentry was standing with his back to them, staring through the periscope over the wire and mud of no-man&#x2019;s-land. He could not afford to lose concentration even for a moment, regardless of what went on behind him.<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;s moi boots,&#x201d; Plugger said between his teeth. &#x201c;Take &#x2019;em off yer soddin&#x2019; feet an&#x2019; give &#x2019;em back to me, or Oi&#x2019;ll take &#x2019;em off yer and give yer to the rats!&#x201d;<br><br>Tucky bounced on the balls of his feet, hunching his shoulders a little. &#x201c;You want to try?&#x201d; he invited.<br><br>Doughy Ward crawled out of his dugout, fully dressed, as they all were: webbing and rifle with bayonet attached. His fair-skinned face was crumpled with annoyance at being robbed of any part of his few hours of sleep. He glared at Joseph. &#x201c; &#x2018;Thou shalt not steal.&#x2019; Isn&#x2019;t that right, Chaplain?&#x201d;<br><br>It was a demand that even here in the mud and the cold, amid boredom and sporadic violence, Joseph should do his job and stand for the values of justice that must remain, or all this would sink into a purposeless hell. Without right and wrong there was no sanity.<br><br>&#x201c;Oi didn&#x2019;t steal them!&#x201d; Tucky said angrily. &#x201c;They were . . .&#x201d; He did not finish the sentence because Plugger hit him, a rolling blow that caught the side of his jaw as he ducked and struck back.<br><br>There was no point in shouting at them, and the sound would carry. Added to which Joseph did not want to let the whole trench know that there was a discipline problem. Both men could end up on a charge, and that was not the way for a chaplain to resolve anything. He moved forward, careful to avoid being struck himself, and grasped hold of Tucky, taking him off balance and knocking him against the uprights that held the trench wall.<br><br>&#x201c;The Germans are that way!&#x201d; he said tartly, jerking his head back toward the parapet and no-man&#x2019;s-land beyond.<br><br>Plugger was up on his feet, slithering in the mud on the duckboards, his socks filthy and sodden. &#x201c;Good oidea to send him over the top, Captain, where he belongs! But not in moi boots!&#x201d; He was floundering toward them, arms flailing as if to carry on the fight.<br><br>Joseph stepped between them, risking being caught by both, the worst part of which would be that then a charge would be unavoidable. &#x201c;Stop it!&#x201d; he ordered briskly. &#x201c;Take the boots off, Nunn!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you, Chaplain,&#x201d; Plugger responded with a smile of satisfaction.<br><br>Tucky stood unmoving, his face set, ignoring the blood. &#x201c;They ain&#x2019;t his boots oither!&#x201d; he said sullenly, his eyes meeting Joseph&#x2019;s.<br><br>A man appeared around the dogleg corner. No stretch of the trench was more than ten or twelve yards long, to prevent shellfire taking out a whole platoon of men&#x2014;or a German raiding party making it through the wire. They were steep-sided, shored up against mud slides, and barely wide enough for two men to pass each other. The man coming was tall and lean with wide shoulders, and he walked with a certain elegance, even on the sloping duckboards. His face was dark, long-nosed, and there was a wry humor in it.<br><br>&#x201c;Early for tea, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; he asked, his eyes going from one to another.<br><br>Tucky and Plugger reluctantly stood to attention. &#x201c;Yes, Major Wetherall,&#x201d; they said almost in unison.<br><br>Sam Wetherall glanced down at Plugger&#x2019;s stockinged feet, his eyebrows raised. &#x201c;Thinking of creeping up on the cook, are you? Or making a quick recce over the top first?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Soon as Oi get moi boots back from that thievin&#x2019; sod, Oi&#x2019;ll put &#x2019;em on again,&#x201d; Plugger replied, gesturing toward Tucky.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d wash them first if I were you,&#x201d; Sam advised with a smile.<br><br>&#x201c;Oi will,&#x201d; Plugger agreed. &#x201c;Oi don&#x2019;t want to catch nothin&#x2019;!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I meant your feet,&#x201d; Sam corrected him.<br><br>Tucky Nunn roared with laughter, in spite of the bruise darkening on his jaw where Plugger had caught him.<br><br>&#x201c;Whose boots are they?&#x201d; Joseph asked, smiling as well.<br><br>&#x201c;Moine!&#x201d; both men said together.<br><br>&#x201c;Whose boots are they?&#x201d; Joseph repeated.<br><br>There was a moment&#x2019;s silence.<br><br>&#x201c;Oi saw &#x2019;em first,&#x201d; Plugger answered.<br><br>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t take them,&#x201d; Tucky pointed out. &#x201c;If you &#x2019;ad, you&#x2019;d &#x2019;ave them now, wouldn&#x2019;t you!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Come on, Solomon.&#x201d; Sam looked at Joseph, his mouth pulled into an ironic twist.<br><br>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; Joseph said decisively. &#x201c;Left boot, Nunn. Right boot, Arnold.&#x201d;<br><br>There was considerable grumbling, but Tucky took off the right boot and passed it over, reaching for one of the worn boots where Plugger had been sitting.<br><br>&#x201c;Shouldn&#x2019;t have had them off now anyway,&#x201d; Sam said disapprovingly. &#x201c;You know better than that. What if Fritz&#x2019;d made a sudden attack?&#x201d;<br><br>Plugger&#x2019;s eyebrows shot up, his blue eyes wide open. &#x201c;At half past three in the afternoon? It&#x2019;s teatoime in a minute. They may be soddin&#x2019; Germans, but they&#x2019;re not uncivilized. They still got to eat an&#x2019; sleep, same as us.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You stick your head up above the parapet, and you&#x2019;ll find he&#x2019;s nowhere near asleep, I promise you,&#x201d; Sam warned.<br><br>Tucky was about to reply when there was a shouting about twenty yards along the line, and a moment later a young soldier lurched around the corner, his face white. He stared at Sam.<br><br>&#x201c;One of your sappers has taken half his hand off!&#x201d; he said, his voice high-pitched and jerky.<br><br>&#x201c;Where is he, Charlie?&#x201d; Joseph said quickly. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll get him to the first-aid post.&#x201d;<br><br>Sam was rigid. &#x201c;Who is it?&#x201d; He started forward, pushing ahead of both of them, ignoring the rats scattering in both directions.<br><br>Charlie Gee swiveled and went on his heels. Joseph stopped to duck into the connecting trench leading back to the second line, and pick out a first-aid pack in case they needed more than the field dressing the wounded man should be carrying himself.<br><br>When he caught up with them Sam was bent over, one arm around a man sitting on the duckboards. The sapper was rocking back and forth, clutching the stump of his hand to his chest, scarlet blood streaming from it.<br><br>Joseph had lost count of how many wounded and dead he had seen, but each man&#x2019;s horror was new, and real, and it looked as if in this case the man might have lost a good deal of his right hand.<br><br>Sam was ashen, his jaw clenched so tight the muscles stood out like cords. &#x201c;We have to see it, Corliss!&#x201d; His voice shook in spite of everything he could do to steady it. &#x201c;We have to stop the bleeding!&#x201d; He looked at Joseph, his eyes desperate.<br><br>Joseph tore open the dressing and, speaking gently to the injured man, took his hand and without examining it, pressed the bandage and the lint over the streaming wound, then bound it as well as he could. He had very little idea how many fingers were left.<br><br>&#x201c;Come on, ol&#x2019; feller,&#x201d; Charlie said, trying to help Corliss to his feet. &#x201c;Oi&#x2019;ll get you back to the doc&#x2019;s and they&#x2019;ll do it for you proper.&#x201d;<br><br>Sam climbed to his feet and pulled Joseph aside as Charlie and Corliss stumbled past.<br><br>&#x201c;Joe, can you go with them?&#x201d; Sam said urgently. He swallowed, gulping. &#x201c;Corliss is in a hell of a state. He&#x2019;s been on the edge of funking it for days. I&#x2019;ve got to find out what happened, put in a report, but the medics&#x2019;ll ask him what caused it. . . . Answer for him, will you?&#x201d; He stopped, but it was painfully apparent he wanted to say more.<br><br>Suddenly Joseph understood. Sam was terrified the man had injured himself deliberately. Some men panicked, worn down by fear, cold, and horror, and put their hands up above the parapet precisely so a sniper would get them. A hand maimed was &#x201c;a Blighty one,&#x201d; and they got sent home. But if it was self-inflicted, it was considered cowardice in the face of the enemy. It warranted a court-martial, and possibly even the death sentence. Corliss&#x2019;s nerves may have snapped. It happened to men sometimes. Anything could trigg...</p><h2>American Massacre</h2><p>The tragedy at Mountain Meadows, September 11, 1857.</p><p>In September 1857, a wagon train passing through Utah laden with gold was attacked. Approximately 140 people were slaughtered; only 17 children under the age of eight were spared. This incident in an open field called Mountain Meadows has ever since been the focus of passionate debate: Is it possible that official Mormon dignitaries were responsible for the massacre? In her riveting book, Sally Denton makes a fiercely convincing argument that they were.<br><br>The author?herself of Mormon descent?first traces the extraordinary emergence of the Mormons and the little-known nineteenth-century intrigues and tensions between their leaders and the U.S. government, fueled by the Mormons? zealotry and exclusionary practices. We see how by 1857 they were unique as a religious group in ruling an entire American territory, Utah, and commanding their own exclusive government and army. <br><br>Denton makes clear that in the immediate aftermath of the massacre, the church began placing the blame on a discredited Mormon, John D. Lee, and on various Native Americans. She cites contemporaneous records and newly discovered documents to support her argument that, in fact, the Mormon leader, Brigham Young, bore significant responsibility?that Young, impelled by the church?s financial crises, facing increasingly intense scrutiny and condemnation by the federal government, incited the crime by both word and deed.<br><br>Finally, Denton explains how the rapidly expanding and enormously rich Mormon church of today still struggles to absolve itself of responsibility for what may well be an act of religious fanaticism unparalleled in the annals of American history. <b>American Massacre</b> is totally absorbing in its narrative as it brings to life a tragic moment in our history.&#x201c;<b>American Massacr</b><i>e</i> brilliantly captures a forgotten episode in our country&#x2019;s history.

He shuddered out the DTs as a watchman on a West Texas oil pipeline. He outraged teachers, cheated mobsters, and almost got himself beaten to death by a homicidal sheriff's deputy. And somewhere along the way, Thompson became one of the greatest crime writers America has ever known.<br><br>In this uproarious autobiographical tale, the author of After Dark, My Sweet and Pop. 1280 tells the story of his chaotic coming of age and reveals just where he acquired his encyclopedic knowledge of human misbehavior. Bad Boy is a bawdy, brawling book of reprobates--and an unfettered portrait of a writer growing up in the Southwest of the Roaring Twenties.</p><p>(1906 - 1977) James Meyers Thompson was born in Anadarko, Oklahoma. He began writing fiction at a very young age, selling his first story to <i>True Detective</i> when he was only fourteen. Thompson eventually wrote twenty-nine novels, all but three of which were published as paperback originals. Thompson also wrote two screenplays (for the Stanley Kubrick films &#x201c;The Killing&#x201d; and &#x201c;Paths of Glory&#x201d;). An outstanding crime writer, the world of his fiction is rife with violence and corruption. In examining the underbelly of human experience and American society in particular, Thompson&#x2019;s work at its best is both philosophical and experimental. Several of his novels have been filmed by American and French directors, resulting in classic noir including <b>The Killer Inside Me</b> (1952), <b>After Dark My Sweet</b> (1955), and <b>The Grifters</b> (1963).Published in 1953 and 1954, respectively, this duo by Thompson offer an autobiographical novel of a tough kid's violent ascent into adulthood and a man's loss of his self-esteem that turns him pretty nasty. Two gritty novels by a master of the crime genre that are must haves for all mystery collections.<br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Medium and Large Format Photography : Moving Beyond 35Mm for Better Pictures</h2><p>Explains how to use and choose the different film formats available beyond 35mm. The advantages and limitations of the various formats and individual manufacturers versions are examined. All the components of a system are covered, including lenses, tripods, light meters and filters.</p><p><b>Roger Hicks</b> and <b>Frances Schultz</b> are a husband-and-wife team with many highly successful books to their credit, including <i>Perfect Exposure</i>, <i>Quality in Photography</i>, and the <i>Pro-Lighting Series</i>. They live in Kent, England.This fine book by two accomplished photographers offers an excellent introduction to medium- and large-format photography. For 35mm photographers eager to move up, it is one of the few titles available about medium-format photography and the only recent one. The authors first discuss the many advantages of working with negatives and transparencies in formats larger than 35mm. They next deal with medium-format equipment, which uses roll film, and then large-format cameras, which rely on sheet film in various sizes, most often ranging from 4" 5" to 8" 10". Each of these chapters includes examples of some of the best equipment available in each category. There is also a separate chapter on lenses and accessories, including tripods, light meters, and filters, and another chapter devoted entirely to the darkroom. The book concludes with brief personal essays by each of the authors and appendixes that include information on Polaroid processes, custom cameras, and suggestions for making better photographs. This informative book is beautifully illustrated with examples of camera equipment and of excellent photographs. Appropriate for all libraries, especially public and academic libraries with good photography collections. Highly recommended. Raymond Bial, Parkland Coll.

Flung together by circumstance, they journey down the Mississippi together on a log raft, each in search of his own definition of freedom. Their daring adventures along the way provide both entertainment and a satirical look at the moral values of the Deep South of the 1800s.</p><p>A seminal work of American Literature that still commands deep praise and still elicits controversy, <i>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i> is essential to the understanding of the American soul. The recent discovery of the first half of Twain's manuscript, long thought lost, made front-page news. And this unprecedented edition, which contains for the first time omitted episodes and other variations present in the first half of the handwritten manuscript, as well as facsimile reproductions of thirty manuscript pages, is indispensable to a full understanding of the novel. The changes, deletions, and additions made in the first half of the manuscript indicate that Mark Twain frequently checked his impulse to write an even darker, more confrontational book than the one he finally published.Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms.

In contrast to the familiar and almost entirely fictional story of Pocahontas and John Smith, the hitherto untold truth of what happened in Virginia in 1610 between the English and the Native Americans they called savages led all the way to the tragedy at Wounded Knee in 1890. By seeing the events through the eyes of two young English brothers, the reader can take sides, following one brother true to his English heritage and the other forsaking it in defense on the Indians&#39; way of life. This is the story of the clash between one civilization and another, and one religion and another. The brutalities common in England in the 17th century contrast with ritual-related penalities acceptable to the Indians. Neither side understood the other, but both put their trust in a god. The fictional brothers, Will and John Jefferys, thread their way through the often horrifying and traumatic events of the year, each finding solace in the arms of women-Will with Jamestown widow, Maggie Beale, and John with Tarapoto, sister of the Paspahegh queen whom the English murdered. All the other principal players were real people doing what comtemporary records say they did. Of necessity, however, their dialogue has been recreated, but motives and attitudes have followed the truth as closely as the sources permit.</p><p>Born and educated in England, Ivor Noel Hume was archaeologist for the City of London from 1949 to 1957 before moving to Virginia to direct Colonial Williamsburg&#39;s Department of Archaeology.

Arthur W. Pink traces the Biblical teachings on God&#39;s covenants with man showing from scripture the existence and meaning of the covenants of works and grace, covenants given to us and our children for all time. This book is a must read and will be appreciated by any serious student of the Scriptures. Arthur Walkington Pink was an English Christian evangelist and Biblical scholar known for his staunchly Calvinist and Puritan-like teachings. Though born to Christian parents, prior to conversion he migrated into a Theosophical society (an occult gnostic group popular in England during that time), and quickly rose in prominence within their ranks. His conversion came from his father&#39;s patient admonitions from Scripture. It was the verse, Proverbs 14:12, &#39;there is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death,&#39; which particularly struck his heart and compelled him to renounce Theosophy and follow Jesus.</p><p>Arthur W. Pink has held various pastorates in the United States. He has been engaged in Bible conference work in the United States, Australia, and other countries and resided in Scotland up until the time of his death, July 15, 1952. Pink was the author of various books and booklets on Bible exposition, as well as the editor and publisher of a Bible study magazine, Studies in the Scriptures.</p><h2>Relative Act of Murder (Dr. Jean Montrose Mystery)</h2><p>The sixth book in the Dr. Jean Montrose series deals with homicide in the Highlands as the &#34;wee doc&#34; of Perth investigates the death of a beautiful and mysterious woman with many enemies.

After his death, there was still more to be told: his admirers discovered a large number of writings he had forgotten, misplaced, never published, or had chosen to omit from his collected works. This volume, the last of eight volumes now reprinted by the University of Nebraska Press, collects the most illuminating of those works.&nbsp;The title work, &#x201c;Jesus of Nazareth,&#x201d; was written in 1848 or 1849; its composition coincided with the most widespread revolutionary ferment seen in Europe. It expresses Wagner&#x2019;s own revolutionary ideals, thoroughly justified (or so he thought) by Jesus and the early Church. At the time Wagner considered Jesus as a revolutionary leader whose struggles with authority and traditions were much like his own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The opening work is &#x201c;Siegfried&#x2019;s Death,&#x201d; a poem written in 1848 that set the tone for his most famous operatic work, the tetralogy <i>Der Ring des Nibelungen</i>. Whole sections of the poem were later incorporated into the fourth Ring opera, <i>Gotterdammerung</i>, but the differences are as revealing as the carryover. &nbsp;The essays that Wagner published in journals but saw fit to exclude from his <i>Gesammelte Schriften</i> might have embarrassed the elderly sage but are key documents to Wagner&#x2019;s activities in his revolutionary period. For example, his ardently prorevolutionary essay, &#x201c;The Revolution,&#x201d; would have displeased the wealthy patrons of his later years.&nbsp;This edition includes the full text of volume 8 of the translation of Wagner&#x2019;s works published in 1899 for the London Wagner Society.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Photography of Invention: American Pictures of the 1980s</h2><p><p><b>Pictures that are made, not taken, are the focus of this exciting collection of works by 90 American artists who are using appropriation, computer technology, performance, and numerous other sources of inspiration to stretch the limits and expand the possibilities of photographic art.</b></p><p>"Perhaps in the future," Man Ray suggested to Duchamp, "photography would replace all art." The Photography of Invention hints at that future by documenting a decade of startling new work in American photography: work that challenges the accepted hierarchy of the arts and, arguably, establishes photography as the equal of the other arts. Pictures that are made, not taken, are the focus of this exciting collection of works by 90 American artists who are using appropriation, computer technology, performance, and numerous other sources of inspiration to stretch the limits and expand the possibilities of photographic art. The selection of nontraditional pictures includes works by some of the decade's most interesting experimenters&#x2015;Cindy Sherman, Sherrie Levine, Richard Prince, Barbara Kruger, William Christenberry, Louise Lawler, Stefan Roloff, and others who create or manipulate the subject photographed. Photography has traditionally been used to capture experience and create images; these works, however, examine preexisting images or image styles that dominate our culture. As Joshua Smith points out "mass media and popular culture advertising, fashion movies, television, video, and other electronic media have made the world photographic, become the common language, and shaped a generation's visual and critical viewpoint." Rather than commenting on or representing life, photography is now an independent art form that has expanded the creative vocabulary of contemporary artists. These "made" pictures encompass a variety of styles and techniques: the artists may fabricate or arrange the subject matter for the camera; invent or subvert traditional styles; present themselves in fictive roles invoking allegory or myth, fantasy and illusion; reassemble existing art objects in new contexts; make the psychic appear real and the real hyperreal. Many pictures are made in the usual optical/chemical manner, creating a tension between the obviously manipulated subject and the inherent "truth" of the photographic print; while others are made by the unconventional use of equipment, processes, and materials that intentionally deny the perfect print There are photograms, photocollages, light drawings, chemical images, marked or painted on negatives, photosilkscreens and photolithographs, and new high tech computer-generated imagery.</p></p><p>Joshua P. Smith is a leading authority on and a collector of avant-garde photography. He was guest curator for the National Museum of American Art exhibition &#34;The Photography of Invention: American Pictures of the 1980s.&#34;</p><h2>Scoop (Occupational Hazards, Book 1)</h2><p>And now back to our regularly scheduled insanity.<br><br>Channel 7 news producer Hugo Talley dreams of working with first-class professionals. Instead he&#x2019;s saddled with a weatherman who can&#x2019;t admit when he&#x2019;s wrong, an aging anchorwoman who refuses to release her clawlike grip on the newsdesk, a conscience-stricken reporter who&#x2019;s reluctant to focus on sensationalism, and a new assistant&#x2013;former homeschool student Hayden Hazard&#x2013;who can&#x2019;t just seem to leave her faith outside the newsroom.<br><br>When the Channel News 7 team inadvertently stumbles on a hot news story, Hugo is frantic to exploit this rare opportunity. But a series of crises&#x2013;including a Botox disaster and the disappearance of a colleague&#x2013;threatens to destroy his chance for ratings success and send him completely over the edge.<br><br>Meanwhile Hayden&#x2019;s presence is distracting at least two coworkers. Softspoken reporter Ray Duffey isn&#x2019;t sure whether he&#x2019;s attracted or frightened by her outspoken faith, while ego-driven Sam Leege is certain her na�ve spiritual convictions will fall victim to his persuasive attentions.<br><br>With their oddball antics and all-too-real foibles, this lovable cast of characters offers a hilarious look at the sometimes-unexpected effects of taking one&#x2019;s faith boldly into the workplace.</p><p><b>Rene Gutteridge</b> is the author of seven novels, including <i>Boo, Boo Who,</i> and <i>Boo Hiss,</i> as well as <i>Ghost Writer</i> and <i>Troubled Waters</i>. Her work as a playwright has been published more than thirty times. A trained screenwriter, she graduated Magna Cum Laude from Oklahoma City University, earning the &#x201c;Excellence in Mass Communication&#x201d; award. She served for five years as the full-time director of drama for First United Methodist Church in Oklahoma City before leaving to be a stay-at-home mom and full-time writer. She enjoys instructing at writer&#x2019;s conferences and college classrooms. Rene lives with her husband, Sean, and their two children, John Caleb and Cate, in Oklahoma.This humorous novel from Gutteridge kicks off her new series, the Occupational Hazards, featuring seven siblings in a clown family that disbands when the parents die in a freak accident. Twenty-five-year-old Hayden Hazard sheds her protected, homeschooled life to strike out on her own as assistant to Channel 7 news producer Hugo Talley. Her innocence, simple faith and good looks attract the attention of reporter Ray Duffey and egomaniacal weatherman Sam Leege. But trouble is brewing: an aging newscaster has overdone the Botox, giving her a permanent happy face while announcing the most terrible tragedies, and Ray is assaulted on the air while doing a story on pig zoning. An explosion at the waste-water treatment plant seems simple, but Ray discovers something stinks more than sewage or the pigs. Hugo pops blue pills for his stress, but even his medicated calm can't quell the looming disaster. As she did in her Boo series, Gutteridge clearly has fun with her story; the pages brim with quirky characters and plenty of laughs. Hayden's crusade against Hugo's antianxiety meds are the only questionable note in the book; readers may see it as a faith versus prescription antidepressants message. Drugs aside, this is a rollicking evangelical ride through the television news world, reminding readers why Gutteridge is such a delightful read. <i>(Oct. 10)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The Siuslaw&#39;s location on the Oregon coast has made the forest a lightning rod for many public lands management issues. These include controversies surrounding the creation of National Forests, Native American reservations, land fraud, World War I lumber procurement, New Deal resettlement programs, World War II coastal defense, the heavy timber production of the post-war decades, and the late 20th century environmental movement. All are played out in a setting of spectacular scenery, quiet communities, and within the endemic economic problems of the Oregon coast. Drawing from rich collections at the Siuslaw National Forest, the Knight Library of the University of Oregon, and the Oregon Historical Society, this collection brings a century of the voices of those who worked on the Forest and lived in the surrounding communities into the present.</p><p></p><h2>Basic Politics of Movement Security</h2><p>Here are two ""live"" discussions by radical activists introducing the issues of movement security: u.s. activist and author J.

With <i>Secret Lives of the Civil War</i>, Cormac O'Brien unearths a host of strange, little-known facts about Abraham Lincoln, Jefferson Davis, Ulysses S. Grant, Robert E. Lee, Thomas 'Stonewall' Jackson, and Harriet Tubman. He also introduces lesser-known people who changed the fate of our country people like: <br> Sarah Edmonds, who disguised herself as a man so she could fight in the Battle of Bull Run (the Civil War had a surprising number of women soldiers). <br> William Clarke Quantrill, a sociopath who fought in both armies, mostly for the pleasure of shedding blood. <br> And of course, Officer Ambrose Burnside, whose unique 'sideburns' would later influence generations of Elvis Presley fans. <p>Complete with 30 dazzling portraits and illustrated maps, <i>Secret Lives of the Civil War</i> is a new look at one of the most fascinating chapters in American history.</p></p><p>Cormac O&#39;Brien is the author of Secret Lives of the U.S. Presidents (Quirk, 2004) and Secret Lives of the First Ladies (Quirk, 2005). He lives in Bloomfield, New Jersey.O'Brien's slight but entertaining follow-up to Secret Lives of the U.S. Presidents and Secret Lives of the First Ladies is best for those who like their history light. O'Brien profiles 26 figures-13 from each side-who consist mostly of military figures, plus the two Presidents and their first ladies, a few spies and the black leaders Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass; he proves most fascinating in the attendant anecdotes (James Longstreet fighting the Battle of Antietam in his slippers, William T. Sherman's two shipwrecks in a single day). Trivia abounds, including all the nicknames of each subject, astrological signs and characteristic quotes ("The moment a grain of black pepper touches my tongue, I lose all strength in my right leg," said Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson, a "notorious hypochondriac"). Unfortunately, the Civil War does not easily lend itself to irreverence or overview; O'Brien has no choice but to slog through battle after battle in order to put the details in context, forsaking in large part such topics as slavery, international relations, munitions and life on the home front. If, in fact, your teachers never told you about these secrets, it's probably because they had bigger fish to fry. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The day is typically unstable, the garden lush and shining, the branches weighty with still-falling rain.&nbsp;<br><br> There is a man and the man is me.<br><br> I am at the back door, tobacco tin in hand, and I am watching something in the trees, a figure, standing at the perimeter of the garden, where the aspens crowd in at the fence. Another man.<br> He&#x2019;s carrying a pair of binoculars and a camera.<br><br> A -bird--watcher, I am telling myself as I pull the frail paper along my tongue, you get them in these parts. But at the same time I&#x2019;m thinking, -Really? -Bird--watching, this far up the valley? I&#x2019;m also thinking, Where is my daughter, the baby, my wife? How quickly could I reach them, if I needed to?<br><br> My heart cranks into high gear, -thud--thudding against my ribs. I squint into the white sky. I am about to step out into the garden. I want the guy to know I&#x2019;ve seen him, to see me seeing him. I want him to register my size, my former -track--and--field--star physique (slackening and loosening a little, these days, admittedly). I want him to run the odds, me versus him, through his head. He&#x2019;s not to know I&#x2019;ve never been in a fight in my life and intend it to stay that way. I want him to feel what I used to feel before my father disciplined me: I am on to you, he would say, with a pointing finger, directed first at his chest, then mine.<br><br> I am on to you, I want to yell while I fumble to pocket my cigarette and lighter.<br><br> The guy is looking in the direction of the house. I see the tinder spark of sun on a lens and a movement of his arm that could be the brushing away of a hair across the forehead or the depression of a camera shutter.<br><br> Two things happen very fast. The dog&#x2014;a whiskery, leggy, slightly arthritic wolfhound, usually given to sleeping by the stove&#x2014; streaks out of the door, past my legs, and into the garden, emitting a volley of low barks, and a woman comes around the side of the house.<br><br> She has the baby on her back, she is wearing the kind of sou&#x2019;wester hood usually sported by North Sea fishermen, and she is holding a shotgun.<br><br> She is also my wife.<br><br> The latter fact I still have trouble adjusting to, not only because the idea of this creature ever agreeing to marry me is highly improbable, but also because she pulls unexpected shit like this all the time.<br><br> &#x201c;Jesus, honey,&#x201d; I gasp, and I am momentarily distracted by how shrill my voice is. &#x201c;Unmanly&#x201d; -doesn&#x2019;t cover it. I sound as if I&#x2019;m admonishing her for an -ill--judged choice in soft furnishings or for wearing pumps that clash with her purse.<br><br> She ignores my high-pitched intervention&#x2014;who can blame her?&#x2014;and fires into the air. Once, twice.<br> If, like me, you&#x2019;ve never heard a gun report at close range, let me tell you the noise is an ear shattering explosion. Magnesium-hued lights go off inside your head; your ears ring with the three-bar high note of an aria; your sinuses fill with tar.<br><br> The sound ricochets off the side of the house, off the flank of the mountain, then back again: a huge aural tennis ball bouncing about the valley. I realize that while I&#x2019;m ducking, cringing, covering my head,&nbsp;the baby is strangely unmoved. He&#x2019;s still sucking his thumb, head leaning against the spread of his mother&#x2019;s hair. Almost as if he&#x2019;s used to this. Almost as if he&#x2019;s heard it all before.<br> I straighten up. I take my hands off my ears. Far away, a figure is sprinting through the undergrowth. My wife turns around. She cracks the gun in the crook of her arm. She whistles for the dog. &#x201c;Ha,&#x201d; she says to me before she vanishes back around the side of the house. &#x201c;That&#x2019;ll show him.&#x201d;<br><br> My wife, I should tell you, is crazy. Not in a requiring-medication-and-wards-and-men-in-white-coats sense although I sometimes wonder if there may have been times in her past&#x2014;but in a subtle, more socially acceptable, less ostentatious way. She -doesn&#x2019;t think like other people. She believes that to pull a gun on someone lurking, in all likelihood entirely innocently, at our perimeter fence is not only permissible but indeed the right thing to do.<br><br>Here are the bare facts about the woman I married:<br> &#x2014;She&#x2019;s crazy, as I might have mentioned.<br> &#x2014;She&#x2019;s a recluse.<br><br> She&#x2019;s apparently willing to pull a gun on anyone threatening to uncover her hiding place.<br> I dart, insomuch as a man of my size can dart, through the house to catch her. I&#x2019;m going to have this out with her. She can&#x2019;t keep a gun in a house where there are small children. She just can&#x2019;t.<br><br> I&#x2019;m repeating this to myself as I pass through the house, planning to begin my protestations with it. But as I come through the front door, it&#x2019;s as if I&#x2019;m entering another world. Instead of the gray drizzle at the back, a dazzling, primrose-tinted sun fills the front garden, which gleams and sparks as if hewn from jewels. My daughter is leaping over a rope that her mother is -turning. My wife who, just a moment ago, was a dark, forbidding figure with a gun, a long gray coat, and a hat like Death&#x2019;s hood, she has shucked off the sou&#x2019;wester and transmogrified back to her usual incarnation. The baby is crawling on the grass, knees wet with rain, the bloom of an iris clutched in his fist, chattering to himself in a satisfied, guttural growl.<br><br>It&#x2019;s as if I&#x2019;ve stepped into another time frame entirely, as if I&#x2019;m in one of those folktales where you think you&#x2019;ve been asleep for an hour or so, but you wake to find you&#x2019;ve been away a lifetime, that all your loved ones and everything you&#x2019;ve ever known are dead and gone. Did I -really just walk in from the other side of the house, or did I fall asleep for a hundred years?<br><br> I shake off this notion. The gun business needs to be dealt with right now. &#x201c;Since when,&#x201d; I demand, &#x201c;do we own a firearm?&#x201d;<br><br> My wife raises her head and meets my eye with a challenging, flinty look, the skipping rope coming to a stop in her hand. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s mine.&#x201d;<br><br> A typical parry from her. She appears to answer the question without answering it at all. She picks on the element that isn&#x2019;t the subject of the question. The essence of sidestepping.<br><br> I rally. I&#x2019;ve had more than enough practice. &#x201c;Since when do you own a firearm?&#x201d;<br><br> She shrugs a shoulder, bare, I notice, and tanned to a soft gold, bisected by a thin white strap. I feel a momentary automatic mobilization deep inside my underwear&#x2014;strange how this doesn&#x2019;t change with age for men, that we&#x2019;re all of us but a membrane away from our inner teenage selves&#x2014;but I pull my attention back to the discussion. She&#x2019;s not going to get away with this.<br><br> &#x201c;Since now,&#x201d; she says.<br><br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s a fire arm?&#x201d; my daughter asks, splitting the word in two, her small, heart-shaped face tilted up to look at her mother.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s an Americanism,&#x201d; my wife says. &#x201c;It means &#x2018;gun.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, the gun,&#x201d; says my sweet Marithe, six years old, equal parts pixie, angel, and sylph. She turns to me. &#x201c;Father Christmas brought Donal a new one, so he said Maman could have his old one.&#x201d;<br><br> This utterance renders me, for a moment, speechless. Donal is an -ill--scented homunculus who farms the land farther down the valley. He&#x2014;and his wife, I&#x2019;d imagine&#x2014;have what you might call a problem with anger management. Somewhat trigger-happy, Donal. He shoots everything on sight: squirrels, rabbits, foxes, -hill walkers (just kidding).<br><br>&#x201c;What is going on?&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re keeping a firearm in the house and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c; &#x2018;Gun,&#x2019; Daddy. Say &#x2018;gun.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;&#x2014;a gun, without telling me? Without discussing it with me? Don&#x2019;t you see how dangerous that is? What if one of the children&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> My wife turns, her hem swishing through the wet grass. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t it nearly time to leave for your train?&#x201d;<br></p></p><h2>M�R, Vol. 12 (12)</h2><p>Could it actually be the beginning of the end?!

The cover is cluttered and confusing, and do we really need 500-plus pages of Foley's boasts? Yes. Foley gives his all for his calling, and he burns to tell his adventures. Take the famous tale of how he lost most of his ear (the bloody result is depicted in the 16-page color-photo section). It was in his 1994 bouts with Vader (Leon White): after getting a broken nose, a dislocated jaw, and 21 stitches in the first match, Foley did his "hangman" routine, wherein he catches his neck between the second and third ropes and spins them into a twist. "The end result is the illusion of a man being hanged by his neck while his body kicks and writhes in an attempt to get out... the man actually <i>is</i> hanging by his neck and the body really <i>does</i> kick and writhe in an attempt to get out." Unfortunately, in the prior match, Too Cold Scorpio had had the officials tighten the ropes, so Foley tore off his ear to avoid death by strangulation, like "a fox that chews off its paw to escape a trap." Foley also wrestles on 10,000-thumbtack mats with barbwire ropes and C-4 explosives, and earns the ultimate compliment: "The fans really like the way you bleed." Many fans also like the way his gory story reads. <i>--Tim Appelo</i>This book is not for the squeamish. No. This is the autobiography of the Hardcore Legend, Mick Foley. Some wrestling fans claim that "Foley is God." You're about to find out why.<p> Mick Foley is a nice man. A family man. He loves his son, Dewey, his daughter, Noelle, and his beautiful wife, Colette. He loves amusement parks, eating ice cream in bed, and watching Nickelodeon.</p><p> So, how to explain his participation in Japanese Death Matches, which replace the ring ropes with barbed wire, cover the mats with glittering gold thumbtacks, and feature C4 explosives scattered throughout the ring? How to explain the barbed-wire scars that zigzag across his body, the second-degree burn tissue that is a memento of an exploding C4, and the missing ear that was ripped clean off his head during a bout? And how to explain how, after losing his ear, he then continued his match?</p><p> Here is an intimate glimpse into Mick Foley's mind, his history, his passions, and what some might call his pathology. No ghostwriter. Not "as told to." Straight from the twisted genius behind Cactus Jack, Dude Love, and Mankind--deciphered from 760 pages of maniacally handwritten notebook paper--comes a tale of blood, sweat, tears, and still more blood.</p><p> You'll chuckle at Mick's early backyard wrestling antics and homemade wrestling movies. You'll be amazed by the inside scoop on legends in the business like Terry Funk, Harley Race, Abdullah the Butcher, and Ric Flair. You'll squirm as Mick describes his incredible risks in the ring and his grisly, mind-numbing injuries. Finally, you will cheer with true admiration as arguably the hardest-working, most dedicated, and most heroic man in sports-entertainment beats all the odds and takes home the prize he had been told all along he would never, ever get: the World Wrestling Federation Championship belt.</p></p><h2>THE Spirit&#39;s Book: The Principles of Spiritist Doctrine</h2><p>In the mid 1800�s, Allan Kardec amassed the greatest wealth of spirit-given material ever assembled. He compiled and organized this vast amount of information dealing with the Hereafter, Godly &amp; Earthly Laws and the realms of Spirits. They form his writings and are the foundation for the world-wide Spiritism Movement.</p><p>The Spirits&#39; Book contains the basic tenets of the Spiritist Doctrine. Organized in the form of questions and answers, it presents a rich collection of dialogues between Allan Kardec and the spirit-instructors. The dialogues cover a broad area of human thought and spirituality. Translated into more than 45 languages, The Spirits&#39; Book is a classic of the spiritual literature.A. Bomfim (Translator - Modern English Edition) Truly fundamental ideas, such as the ones presented here, are supposed to withstand the test of time. A language, however, is as dynamic as the people who use it, and the expressions that give live and relevance to an idea in one era tend to lose currency in the next. To continue relying on the century-old, first English edition by Anna Blackwell, would be a grave injustice--to modern readers of the work, to Kardec&#39;s impeccable reasoning, and to the guide&#39;s illuminating insights.</p><h2>Geronimo Stilton : Lost Treasure of the Emerald Eye</h2><p>brand new and never used but name was accidentally written on inside of front cover</p><p></p><h2>Water: The Element of Life</h2><p><blockquote>"Water's flow constantly links life and death.

Gaustad of <i>The Religious History of America</i>. Widely published as a cultural historian, essayist, and reviewer, he has won book prizes from the American Studies Association, the American Society of Church History, and the American Academy of Religion.</p>Starred Review. Princeton religious historian Schmidt provides a sweeping and detailed look at the forefathers, and foremothers, of today's spirituality movement. From Emerson and the American Transcendentalists through early yoga exponents and up to media empress Oprah Winfrey, Schmidt labels, links and differentiates the strains of spiritual ferment and longing woven into American religious and cultural history. He claims the spiritual-but-not-religious crowd has always been here, often linked to progressive social and political activists via a social gospel. Having established the appreciable history of American spirituality, Schmidt's last chapter argues against the common critique of it as narcissistic and vapid. It is rather the changing expression of a broad American spiritual left that can counter today's dominant spiritual right. It's as grounded in history as any conservatism but also dynamic and capacious enough to accommodate different paths. Written following the rules of academia&#x2014;with endnotes citing 19th-century journals and correspondence&#x2014;yet highly accessible, Schmidt is sympathetic and scholarly about a wide variety of spiritual pilgrims and paths. This is recommended reading for anyone with an interest in American spirituality, and required reading for anyone who thinks spirituality was born after WWII with the baby boomers.<i> (Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But to Rowan Hood, the gentle healer who has waited two long years to put names to the men who murdered her mother, they are fuel to feed her desire for revenge.

Yet she finds that the closer she draws to them, the farther she feels from the healer she has become.</p></p><p><b>Nancy Springer</b> has published forty novels for adults, young adults and children. In a career beginning shortly after she graduated from Gettysburg College in 1970, Springer wrote for ten years in the imaginary realms of mythological fantasy, then ventured on contemporary fantasy, magical realism, and women's fiction before turning her attention to children's literature. Her novels and stories for middle-grade and young adults range from contemporary realism, mystery/crime, and fantasy to her critically acclaimed novels based on the Arthurian mythos, I AM MORDRED: A TALE OF CAMELOT and I AM MORGAN LE FAY. Springer's children's books have won her two Edgar Allan Poe awards, a Carolyn W. Field award, various Children's Choice honors and numerous ALA Best Book listings. Her most recent series include the Tales of Rowan Hood, featuring Robin Hood&#x2019;s daughter, and the Enola Holmes mysteries, starring the much younger sister of Sherlock Holmes.<p> Ms. Springer lives in East Berlin, Pennsylvania. </p>Grade 4-7&#x2013;Rowan Hood, the famous outlaw's bold, brave, and sensitive daughter, founds her own band of cohorts in Sherwood Forest to avenge her mother's death. Princess Ettarde, Lionel, and Rook have been featured in separate books in the series and many of the plot elements from the earlier titles carry over into this concluding volume. It opens in spring with Etty's arrival and her revelation to Rowan of the names of her mother's murderers. The teen decides to seek vengeance, severely testing the loyalty of each member of her band. Rowan is gathering coltsfoot when she senses a profound change. Her special powers seem to be waning and she is filled with a sense of foreboding. Once she sets her course, to return to Celandine's wood, her little band undertakes a long and perilous journey. The talents of each member are called upon as they venture through a landscape filled with bounty hunters, man traps, bad weather, and poor cover. The young outlaws and Rowan's uncanny wolf-dog, Tykell, defy capture, witness two knights' fight to the death, and call on the <i>aelfin </i>folk for guidance. As 15-year-old Rowan faces not only physical dangers, but also the detrimental effects of revenge seeking, she approaches adulthood and an awareness of how best to use her powers. Springer weaves enough of the previous stories in for readers new to the series to follow the action, but this final volume is best read as the satisfying conclusion to the saga.<i>&#x2013;Kathryn Kosiorek, Cuyahoga County Public Library, Brooklyn, OH</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Toklas, but this darker and more complex work was long misunderstood and neglected. An account of her experiences in the wake of having authored a bestseller, Everybody&#39;s Autobiography is as funny and engaging as The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas, but it is also a searing meditation on the meaning of success and identity in America. Posing as the representative American, Stein transforms her story into history--responding to the tradition of Thoreau and Henry Adams, she writes: &#34;I used to be fond of saying that America, which was supposed to be a land of success, was a land of failure. Most of the great men in America had a long life of early failure and a long life of later failure.&#34; Everybody&#39;s Autobiography is Stein at her most accessible and her most serious, and may yet prove to be among her most popular books.</p><p>This marks the pioneer modernist's second title to be recently reprinted ( Geography and Plays , Classic Returns, LJ 1/94), indicating perhaps a Stein renaissance. Stein knew everybody who was anybody, and in this title, she spills the dope on them all in one of the more easily readable of her many works.

With laughter as an analytical tool, he uses his own very average, if sometimes uproarious experiences as a key to his exceptional age cohort. He writes about the way the post-war generation somehow came of age by never quite growing up and created a better society by turning society upside down.<br> <i>THE BABY BOOM: How it Got That Way And It Wasn&#x2019;t My Fault And I&#x2019;ll Never Do It Again</i> is at once a social history, a group memoir of collectively impaired memory, a hilarious attempt to understand his generation&#x2019;s messy hilarity, and a celebration of the mess the Baby Boom has made.</p><p><p><b>P.J. O'Rourke and Dave Barry in Conversation</b></p> <p>In the first paragraph of the prologue to his new book, <em>The Baby Boom: How It Got That Way... And It Wasn't My Fault... And I'll Never Do It Again</em>, political humor writer P.J. O'Rourke declares in no uncertain terms that he is "full of crap." Similarly, in the introduction to his upcoming book, <em>You Can Date Boys When You're Forty</em>, humor columnist Dave Barry explains that his book, despite its subtitle "Parenting and Other Topics He Knows Very Little About," is not about parenting.</p> <p>It's easy to imagine that when these two bestselling authors and longtime pals get together, commiserative silliness ensues. But in this case, no imagination is necessary. We popped in on an email exchange between these two masters of existential trolling. Here's what happened:</p> <p><strong>Dave Barry: </strong>P.J. &#x2014; I loved <em>The Baby Boom</em> which manages to be both hilarious and insightful. What I want to know is: How did you remember all that stuff? Especially about the '60s. Didn't you take drugs? Of course not! Neither did I! Drugs are bad! But my memories of that era are very purple-hazy, whereas you seem to remember every detail of everything that happened. How did you do that?</p> <p><strong>P.J. O'Rourke: </strong>I made it up. I'm a professional reporter. I'm PAID to make things up. Actually, I do remember a lot about the '60s. Probably because I still know a lot of the same people. And they're still yelling at me about things I did back then. Keeps memories fresh. Sort of like a wife. Just kidding, dear. Sort of like a first wife. And I loved <em>You Can Date Boys When You're Forty</em>. You admit you went to a Justin Bieber concert. Kind of pushing the envelope even for a confessional memoir. You're brave, dude, brave.</p> <p><strong>DB: </strong>I did indeed go to a Justin Bieber concert, because my daughter really really really wanted to go because she LOVED Justin Bieber. It was terrifying. I was in Coral Gables, Florida, in 1992 when Hurricane Andrew passed over and nearly took off the roof of the home in which I was cowering. I understood then why the noise of a hurricane is always compared to a freight train. What it SHOULD be compared to is a Justin Bieber concert. Given the choice, I'd rather sit through Andrew again.</p> <p><strong>PJO: </strong>When I pick my daughters up from school they, for some reason I can't imagine, don't want to listen to Rush Limbaugh, and so they tune the radio to what sounds to me like somebody donated 200 drum sets and an Auto-Tune to a juvenile delinquent corrections facility. But does this mean today's music sucks? Yes.</p> <p>Read the full conversation on <strong>Omnivoracious</strong>.</p>P. J.

He lives in Terrace Park, Ohio.<br><p>PreS-K-What a wonderful noisy book this is. Outside of the school is a huge, deep, and hungry mud puddle. Along comes the pizza van, "Beep, beep," and "Slurp"-the truck is stuck. The police car, the tow truck, the backhoe, and finally the fire engine come as rescuers but each one is swallowed up by the growing menace. Out of the school come the preschoolers carrying their shovels and pails and dressed in boots and rain gear. They attack the puddle as only preschoolers can, using up all of the mud and freeing the vehicles. They don't stop until the villain disappears. The cars beep and grind and roar and whistle and howl. The mud puddle slurps and glurps. Readers can virtually hear the trumpets shout as the preschoolers tear out of the school and joyfully set to work. The repetition and rhyme carry the story along and the fun doesn't stop until the book is closed. The artwork is perfect. The pizza truck dances along, bouncing confidently through the rain. The mud puddle lies in wait with a big, ugly, menacing face. Even the font shouts when it should. The animal characters are gleeful. And that just might be a sleeping mud puddle face under the wheelbarrow, waiting for the next rain.

She includes more than 600 recipes, each one serving 10 to 12 guests, and each containing do-ahead components that can be made ahead and refrigerated or frozen (many recipes can be completely cooked advance).

Phillips's advice on how much food readers will need is helpful, as are her "diva rescues" tips (e.g., what to do if extra people show up for the party; if your rice burns; if your layer cake "looks like Mt. Etna erupting"; etc.). Encompassing casual, "grazing," holiday, informal and elegant events, this book will be essential for novices and may also teach some old dogs new tricks.

While working as a marriage counselor for more than 30 years, he identified five love languages: Words of Affirmation, Quality Time, Receiving Gifts, Acts of Service, and Physical Touch. In a friendly, often humorous style, he unpacks each one. Some husbands or wives may crave focused attention; another needs regular praise. Gifts are highly important to one spouse, while another sees fixing a leaky faucet, ironing a shirt, or cooking a meal as filling their "love tank." Some partners might find physical touch makes them feel valued: holding hands, giving back rubs, and sexual contact. Chapman illustrates each love language with real-life examples from his counseling practice. <p> How do you discover your spouse&#x2019;s &#x2013; and your own &#x2013; love language? Chapman&#x2019;s short questionnaires are one of several ways to find out. Throughout the book, he also includes application questions that can be answered more extensively in the beautifully detailed companion leather journal (an exclusive Amazon.com set).

Yet many men feel greatly misunderstood by their women, while just as many women feel mystified and powerless to help their men.</em><br> &#x2014;Mary Farrar, <em>Reading Your Male</em></p> <p>Now author Mary Farrar confirms that every woman&#x2014;whether a wife, mother, or single woman&#x2014;can play a powerful and pivotal role in the male sexual struggle by entering into her man's world, and:</p> <em>seeing</em> through his eyes, <em>thinking</em> with his mind, <em>feeling </em>with his emotions, <em>connecting</em> with his soul. <p><em>Reading Your Male</em> de-mystifies inner male sexuality, exposes the enemy's tactics in taking down our men, and equips women to use their innate gifts in becoming a man's greatest ally in the fight for victory. Using biblical insight and up-to-date research, Farrar also tackles some of the most elusive questions women are asking today, such as:</p> Why do men struggle so deeply in the area of sexuality? What are we to think about pornography and masturbation? Why does this generation of men appear to be so reticent? What does a man crave most from a woman? What is a woman's most powerful gift to her man? How can a woman draw out an emotionally unavailable man? What is a healthy view of strong femininity and beauty?</p><p></p><h2>Six American Poets: An Anthology</h2><p>Here are the most enduring works of six great American poets, collected in a single authoritative volume. From the overflowing pantheism of Walt Whitman to the exquisite precision of Emily Dickinson; from the democratic clarity of William Carlos Williams to the cerebral luxuriance of Wallace Stevens; and from Robert Frost's deceptively homespun dramatic monologues to Langston Hughes's exuberant jazz-age lyrics, this anthology presents the best work of six makers of the modern American poetic tradition. <b>Six American Poets</b> includes 247 poems, among them such famous masterpieces as "I Hear America Singing," "The Idea of Order at Key West," "The Dance," and "Mending Wall," as well as lesser-known works. With perceptive introductory essays by the distinguished scholar Joel Conarroe and selections that capture the distinctive voices and visions of its authors, this volume is an invaluable addition to any poetry library.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>The author of books and essays about American poetry and fiction and the editor <b>Six American Poets</b>, Joel Conarroe is president of the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, which awards fellowships to artists and scholars. He has previously served as chairman of the English department and dean of arts and sciences at the University of Pennsylvania and as executive director fo the Modern Language Association. He has earned degrees from Davidson College, Cornell University, and New York University, and has been awarded honorary doctorates by several institutions.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>Unlike most recent anthologies of American poetry--which, because they are directed largely at an audience of other poets, strive frantically to be as inclusive as possible--Conarroe's selection aims at "the general reader interested in being introduced, in an unhurried way, to some major voices." Selections are from America's greatest and most representative poets: Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, Wallace Stevens, William Carlos Williams, Robert Frost, and Langston Hughes. Though one may cavil at particular omissions or inclusions, especially the practice of excerpting Whitman's "Song of Myself," Conarroe's anthology is a superb introduction to the pleasures of poetry for the general reader. The fine introduction and prefaces provide added assistance to those who, starting here, will doubtlessly want to continue ex ploring poetry. Highly recommended. BOMC selection.<br><i>- Frank J.

At a town meeting, Christine volunteers to investigate a forty-year-old murder case long since closed. Now she&#39;ll move heaven and earth to exonerate a pair of retarded savant twins, now senior citizens, of their mother&#39;s murder on Good Friday in 1950.</p><p>I always look forward to a new mystery by Lee Harris. Her novels about ex-nun Christine Bennett are in that central range between cozy and hardboiled -- the perfect balance. Ever since I encountered Christine Bennett in THE GOOD FRIDAY MURDER, which was nominated for an Edgar Award as best first novel, I've been fascinated by the author's depiction and development of her heroine -- Christine matures in surprising (but always believeable ways) as the series continues.

Keeping a secret requires rather sophisticated thinking. I don't think he has it.... Still, forty years have passed and he's said nothing." </p><p>"Maybe he was locked in a bedroom while it happened." </p><p>"Possibly. But he would know who locked him up, wouldn't he?" </p><p>The mother of "idiot savant" twins was brutally murdered with her own kitchen knife on Good Friday, 1950.

This season in particular, heralded by the vernal equinox, had wafted in with honeysuckle-scented breezes, daffodils in starchy yellow tutus, belligerent thunderstorms, and the annual tsunami of hormones in the corridors of the high school -- evidence of which could be found strewn along the banks of Boone Creek in the aftermath of moonlit nights. There may also have been a time to every purpose under the heaven, but it was hard to discern. </p><p> Especially for professional bowling. </p><p> I was in the front room (one of two, the other designated as the back room) of the red-bricked police department, situated catty-corner to the antiques store and with a clear view of the one stoplight in town, studying seed catalogues as if I might do something of a more botanical bent than planting my fanny in my cane-bottomed chair. Crime had skidded to a halt in Maggody, Arkansas, as far as I knew. The gingham curtains flapped sluggishly as I waged an internal debate: petunias versus marigolds, cucumbers versus zucchini. The possibilities were endless and the photographs lush. The tomatoes were worthy of excessive salivation when envisioned with four strips of crispy bacon and a generous slathering of mayonnaise between two slices of white bread. Only Yankees defile such perfection with lettuce. </p><p> My official title was Chief of Police Arly Hanks; defender of law, order, justice, the American way, and whatever else I'd been hired to do, having been the sole applicant with qualifications, or without, for that matter. My job mostly consisted of nailing speeders at the edge of town -- I run a quality speed trap -- and tracking down miscreants who failed to pay at the self-service pumps. Leaping over tall buildings in a single bound was not a challenge, since Maggody lacked them. Bank robberies were not a threat, the branch having burned to the ground a while back. Ditto the post office, as well as the Esso station out by the one-lane bridge. The block or so of what had been thriving businesses thirty years ago was now a stretch of hollow shells, the windows taped with bleached newspapers and flyers promoting events that had long since come and gone. Dunkin' Donuts and Burger King were not vying for the best location, and about all we could hope for was Toys Were Us. </p><p> There had been some bizarre moments, but these days we were reduced to Saturday night temper tantrums at the pool hall, a rare flareup on the bench outside the barbershop, and my dedicated (depending on the weather, anyway) attempts to find Raz Buchanon's moonshine operation up on Cotter's Ridge. For the most part, Maggody, Arkansas (population 755), was percolating just fine. Having come home to recuperate after a nasty divorce from a New York City advertising hotshot with silk boxers and a polyester mindset, I wanted nothing more than the opportunity to pull myself back together. And, well, a bacon and tomato sandwich, washed down with a cold beer and topped off with a slice of lemon meringue pie. </p><p> I was pondering where I might actually plant tomatoes when, to my deep dismay, the door burst open and Dahlia (nee O'Neil) Buchanon thundered into the PD. Three hundred plus pounds does thunder. </p><p> "Fire!" she shrieked. </p><p> "I don't smell smoke." </p><p> "At Ruby Bee's!" </p><p> Ruby Bee's Bar &amp; Grill, for the unenlightened, is the establishment owned by my very own mother, whose nickname is short for Rubella Belinda, the family having an unfortunate tradition of choosing names for their melodic impact rather than pathology. The peculiar pink building is a hundred yards down the road from the PD, and the source for the majority of my carbohydrates, as well as all the local gossip, from Elsie's bunions to Mayor Jim Bob Buchanon's latest, but surely not last, excursion into infidelity. </p><p> "What do you mean?" I asked. </p><p> "I mean there's a fire, darn it! I was taking the babies for a walk, then I saw the smoke and -- " </p><p> I stumbled to my feet. "A fire?" </p><p> "I swear," Dahlia said, wiping her cheeks with a tissue she'd pulled from a pocket hidden among the folds of her dress, "sometimes I wonder if you was huntin' wiffle birds when God passed out the brains. Smoke's pouring out of the bar. Bocaraton liked to run me over driving out of the parking lot, and Estelle is there, screeching to high heavens. It seems to me you might want to look into this, it being your mother and all." </p><p> Dahlia was far from being the tightest-wrapped Twinkie in the carton, but she had a point. I went around her and out to the edge of the road, sidestepping the double stroller constraining a pair of pensive, thumb-sucking passengers. Smoke was indeed pouring out of the bar, and an impromptu demolition derby was shaping up. Estelle Oppers, my mother's best friend and coconspirator in high crimes and misdemeanors, was flapping her arms like a woodpecker that had chanced upon a nest of plump termites. </p><p> "Did someone call the fire department in Hasty?" I asked Dahlia. </p><p> "How am I supposed to know that? I was a fire-drill monitor in sixth grade until Miz Myner caught me smoking in the girls' restroom. I was always real careful to put my butts in the toilet, but she still took away my badge and gave it to pimply ol' Himroyd Buchanon. He cackles about it to this day." She put her fists on what I supposed were her hips and stuck her face in mine; it was likely that one of us was on a sugar-high, and not from gazing at photographs of sweet potatoes. "Why doncha ask him if he called 'em, assuming you can lure him out of the root cellar behind his house? What's it been now -- four years?" </p><p> I left her grumbling and hightailed it to the parking lot. There were no flames visible, but the smoke was hard to ignore, as well as the chaotic retreat of trucks, cars, and errant husbands who had no business guzzling beer at noon with their busty sweeties from the Pot O' Gold trailer park at the south end of town. </p><p> Estelle grabbed my arm. "You got to do something!" </p><p> "Is Ruby Bee in there?" </p><p> "She's in the kitchen with the fire extinguisher. I did my best to drag her out, but -- " </p><p> I yanked myself free and barged inside. The fire seemed to be contained, but I could hear Ruby Bee howling, although in outrage rather than in pain. I snatched a thick wad of napkins from a dispenser, then took a deep breath, covered my mouth and nose, and opened the kitchen door. Smoke roiled at me, stinging my eyes and seeping through the napkins to scald my throat. </p><p> Ruby Bee was wielding the fire extinguisher with the confidence of a seasoned urban firefighter, swinging back and forth as she blasted the flames licking on the stove. If she were up against a dragon, I knew where I'd put my money. </p><p> "Git out of here!" she snarled without turning around. "I already said it's under control." She added a few comments that do not bear repeating, although I will admit I was impressed with her command of four-letter words. My fiftyish mother, with her rosy face, ruffled apron tied around a thick waist, pink eye shadow, and suspiciously blonde hair, could have matched any sailor in a bar in San Diego, hands down. </p><p> Forget I said that. </p><p> The fire was pretty much gasping its last. I opened the back door and the windows, then sat on a stool and waited until she set down the fire extinguisher. She and everything else, including me, were coated with a slimy film of yellowish powder. </p><p> "Grease fire, huh?" I said. </p><p> "Guess I don't have to call in a rocket scientist after all," she said as she used her apron to blot her eyes. "What happened was I was frying up some chicken when the phone rang. Duluth was carryin' on like circus elephants was putting up tents in his backyard, then Mrs. Jim Bob came in and started yacking at me about chaperoning a field trip.

It was not until he was in jail, that he decided the war must really be over. In this memoir, Davis discusses the specifics of the war, offering his own vantage point of the brutal struggle in hopes that everyone else would come to see it his way. During the war, Davis faced enormous problems: state governors who didn&#39;t want to answer to a central government and generals who didn&#39;t trust his military judgement. Discussing in detail other important civilian leaders and generals on both sides, Davis attempts to deflect the charges of personal failure. He depicts the North as a savage agressor, to which the South stands in both military and moral opposition.

But why not throw in a little sex anyway? The latest offering in the His series lives up to its predecessors in presenting the sweaty and steamy beside the thoughtful and heartfelt. Rick Sandford's "Manifest White," Gary Bowen's "Barrel Racer," and Micheal Skeef's "Blood Brothers" are graphic accounts of pickups, though both Skeef's and Bowen's stories gradually unfold other possibilities. Lawrence Reilly's "1984" recounts a high school boy's sexual conquest of a country club tennis pro. In Reginald M. Harris Jr.'s "Haram," a young Arab immigrant maintains a wary interest in a "BlackAmerican" who rides his train each day. The simultaneous publication of <i>His</i> and its lesbian counterpart, <i>Hers</i>, begs a comparison between lesbian and gay fiction (at least as reflected in the choices of editors Robert Drake and Terry Wolverton) that warrants more space than we have here.

Grant and the War They Failed to See</h2><p>"Highly recommended&#x2013;a gripping narrative of the critical year of 1858 and the nation's slide toward disunion and war. Chadwick is especially adept at retelling the intense emotions of this critical time, particularly especially in recounting abolitionist opposition to the Fugitive Slave Act and Jefferson Davis's passionate defense of this institution. For readers seeking to understand how individuals are agents of historical change will find Chadwick's account of the failed leadership of President James Buchanan, especially compelling."<br><br>-G. Kurt Piehler, author of "Remembering War the American Way" and Associate Professor of History, The University of Tennessee<br><br>1858 explores the events and personalities of the year that would send the America's North and South on a collision course culminating in the slaughter of 630,000 of the nation's young men, a greater number than died in any other American conflict. The record of that year is told in seven separate stories, each participant, though unaware, is linked to the oncoming tragedy by the central, though ineffective, figure of that time, the man in the White House, President James Buchanan. <br><br>The seven figures who suddenly leap onto history's stage and shape the great moments to come are: Jefferson Davis, who lived a life out of a Romantic novel, and who almost died from herpes simplex of the eye; the disgruntled Col. Robert E. Lee, who had to decide whether he would stay in the military or return to Virginia to run his family's plantation; William Tecumseh Sherman, one of the great Union generals, who had been reduced to running a roadside food stand in Kansas; the uprising of eight abolitionists in Oberlin, Ohio, who freed a slave apprehended by slave catchers, and set off a fiery debate across America; a dramatic speech by New York Senator William Seward in Rochester, which foreshadowed the civil war and which seemed to solidify his hold on the 1860 Republican Presidential nomination; John Brown's raid on a plantation in Missouri, where he freed several slaves, and marched them eleven hundred miles to Canada, to be followed a year later by his catastrophic attack on Harper's Ferry; and finally, Illinois Senator Steven Douglas' seven historic debates with little-known Abraham Lincoln in the Illinois Senate race, that would help bring the ambitious and determined Lincoln to the Presidency of the United States. <br><br>As these stories unfold, the reader learns how the country reluctantly stumbled towards that moment in April 1861 when the Southern army opened fire on Fort Sumter.</p><p>As 1858 dawned, the men who would become the iconic figures of the Civil War had no idea it was about to occur: Jefferson Davis was ill from an attack of herpes; Robert E. Lee was on the verge of resigning from the military; and William Tecumseh Sherman had been reduced to running a roadside food stand. Meanwhile, the maniacal President James Buchanan was raving over perceived threats to his power. He did nothing as debates erupted around the country following two violent attempts by white Northerners to free Southern slaves.<br><br>By the end of 1858, Jefferson Davis had become the South's spokesman for the secessionist cause, New York Senator William Seward attested the Union was in "irresistible conflict" over slavery that might end in war, the anti-slavery advocate Abraham Lincoln had lost a Senate seat but had won the respect of millions, and the North and South were set on a collision course that would end with the deaths of 630,000 young men.<br><br>This is the story of seven men on the brink of a war that would transform them into American legends, and the events of the year that set our union on fire.<br><br>Bruce Chadwick is a former journalist and author of eight works of history, including The First American Army, George Washington's War, The General and Mrs. Washington, Brother Against Brother, Two American Presidents, Traveling the Underground Railroad and The Reel Civil War.

The New Year arrived on a cold but sunny day. It was welcomed with parties and receptions all over the nation's capital. The Republicans and Democrats who had fought so bitterly throughout 1857 over the slavery issue put aside their differences and mingled with each other at the homes of the country's political leaders. One of the most well-attended receptions took place at the home of Vice President John Breckinridge, a thirty-seven-year-old former Kentucky slaveholder and rising political star. Another party was hosted by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, James Orr. Several cabinet members flung open the doors of their homes for guests invited to similar receptions. Senators and congressmen, such as Jefferson Davis of Mississippi, Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri, John Slidell of Louisiana, William Bigler of Pennsylvania, and George Pugh of Ohio, held lavish soir�es. The most important public figures in public life attended these parties, wearing their best suits and hats. They were accompanied by their wives, dressed in fashionable gowns and adorned in expensive jewelry. <br><br>Continuing a tradition, President James Buchanan, in office just under a year, hosted a three-hour reception at the White House for members of the diplomatic corps, Democratic members of the Senate and House, and political friends on the morning of New Year's Day. Guests arrived at the White House just before eleven o'clock in the morning and remained until the middle of the afternoon. There were several hundred of them and they came in a continuous parade of elegant carriages. At noon, the front doors of the White House were opened to the public to meet the president. Thousands of ordinary people walked into the executive mansion, many for the very first time, all impressed with its size. After a lengthy wait in a receiving line, they met President Buchanan, who wished them all a Happy New Year. <br><br>The atmosphere at the president's New Year's reception was jovial and most of the conversation between the fifteenth president and his guests did not involve the issue of slavery that seemed about to overwhelm America. Everyone was grateful for that. The year 1857 had been difficult. A recession that sent financial markets reeling in the past year still crippled the dollar, weakened the banks, and hurt the import/export trade. Unemployment was up, factories shut their doors, the federal government ran a deficit, the public staged runs on banks, and financially pressed banks could not meet their specie payments.2 Hinton Helper's book, The Impending Crisis of the South, highly critical of Southerners and slavery that was published during the previous year, was still the central topic of many conversations. At the end of the year, politicians in the Kansas Territory, eager to bring it into the Union as a state, had sent Congress not one, but two state constitutions, one recognizing slavery and one not, for a decision. Three congressmen were forced to resign during the year following a corruption scandal connected to the 1856 campaign. <br><br>In addition, Buchanan sent an army of twenty-five hundred men on an ill-advised expedition to Utah to put down what he described as an uprising of Mormons; the result was a debacle that included an attack by Indians on the troopers, the burning of army supply wagon trains, destruction of crops and homes to deny the army food, and lengthy journeys through snow�bound mountain passes by the army across what one trooper described as "the most desolate country I have ever beheld."3 The expedition was a humiliation of the army and the administration. <br><br>An illegal slave ship jammed with six hundred captives, possibly headed for America, was intercepted off the coast of Africa in a well-publicized seizure at the end of November, and its capture was followed by reports of other slave vessels that had secretly made it to the United States. <br><br>An American adventurer, William Walker, led a coup against the govern�ment of Nicaragua and seized control of the country, only to be deposed by the forces of neighboring nations. <br><br>And all across the nation, controversy still raged over the Supreme Court's Dred Scott decision, handed down in March of 1857, in which the high court upheld the Fugitive Slave Act, reappealed the Missouri Compromise of 1850, decided that Congress could not declare any territory free, and ruled that slaves were not people, but property. And, on top of all that, the population of America continued to explode, increasing by nearly 25 percent over the last decade. <br><br>No one was happier to move forward and put 1857 behind him than President James Buchanan. The president was an odd-looking man. He was tall and heavy-set, with a mop of curly white hair. He had had throat and nasal growths surgically removed, but the operations, primitive in the era, left large and ugly scars on his neck. He also suffered from myopic vision that forced him to bend his head severely to the left and forward in order to read, further exposing the huge scars he tried to hide with very high shirt collars. His vision caused him to squint severely whenever he read something or tried to look out over a crowded room, further adding to his unusual appearance. One of his eyes was brown and the other hazel. His forward-leaning head also misled many into thinking he agreed with what they said. He was a big man, but oddly had tiny feet that he bragged about to everyone he met. <br><br>Buchanan had arrived in Washington as the victor in a close presidential race in 1856 in which he was the nominee of a disorganized and overly confident Democratic Party that found itself fighting for its life at the polls against the fiery new Republicans, who had replaced the defunct Whigs, and the zealots of the American Party, who mounted a strong third-party challenge. Buchanan had carried nineteen of the forty-one states and won the election with 59 percent of the electoral vote, but the Republicans surprised everyone. Their presidential nominee, explorer John C. Fremont, won eleven states. Fremont had earned the nickname "the Pathfinder" following his five well-publicized expeditions through the Rocky Mountains and the Great Plains over the previous decade. A third-party candidate, former president Millard Fillmore, a sectional candidate running on the ticket of the American Party (an anti-Catholic and anti-immigrant group formerly called the "Know-Nothings"), captured one state. <br>Buchanan earned 45 percent of the popular vote, giving up 30 percent to Fremont and 25 percent to Fillmore. If Fillmore had carried several Southern states and denied Buchanan the election, or forced it into the House of Representatives, Fremont would have come close to winning the election outright. Buchanan won his home state, Pennsylvania, by just 577 votes out of nearly 500,000 cast, and Indiana by less than 2,000 out of 235,000. He only earned 105,528 votes in Illinois, 44.1 percent, against 130,306 cast against him, but was awarded the state's eleven electoral votes because his two opponents split that larger ballot. Even Buchanan was forced to admit that the loss of just two states would have given Fremont the White House.</p><h2>Ice Blues: A Donald Strachey Mystery (Stonewall Inn Mystery)</h2><p>Shocked to discover the body of the grandson of the godfather of Albany's political machine in his car, P.I. Donald Strachey knows he is in for trouble. But when he learns that the murder victim left a $2.5 million legacy with instructions that it be used to destroy that machine, along with a personal letter to Strachey asking for his help, his suspicions are confirmed. Faced with power-brokers at all levels, Albany's only gay P.I. tries to fulfill the dead man's mission-with his own survival at stake.<br></p><p>Don Strachey is the gay private eye who scored a hit in Stevenson's thriller, On the Other Hand, Death. A case of murder keeps Strachey and his lover, Timmy Callahan, at home in Albany during a fierce winter because the victim was planted in the detective's car. The dead man, Jack Lenihan, had left a letter in which he asked Strachey to deliver 2.5 million in laundered money to the city's reform political party. But the money has vanished, sending Strachey on a dangerous errand to recover it from merciless killers. Suspecting that Lenihan had stolen the fortune from the drug dealers who were his former associates, Strachey flies to Los Angeles to question Lenihan's mother and friends, a mission with stunning results.

The text is set in two columns, and different color tones are used in the illustrations for each holiday. Bold designs are mixed with objects portrayed with photographic realism and with cartoon-like characters, for a confusion of purpose. Drawings of symbolic objects that accompany each holiday are provided, and a two-page quiz at the end challenges readers' memories for these objects. Noticeably missing from the book is an introduction to provide a context or setting, or even to explain the selections and bias of the author. The book presumes background knowledge in Jewish traditions. While primary-grade students may have difficulty reading the text due to potentially unfamiliar vocabulary, upper-graders might be put off by the picture-book format. There is still a need for a distinguished, self-contained, and attractive book that children can use on their own. However, for religious schools or large collections, the bright, cheerful format will be appealing. For a broader context at a similar level, Jewish Holidays (Watts, 1985) by Judith Greenberg and Helen Carey will provide helpful background, while Margery Cuyler's Jewish Holidays (Holt, 1978) can be used with younger children. Leda Schubert, Grand Avenue School, Uniondale, N.Y.<br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.With a minimum of repetition and a generous amount of examples and stories, Cashman provides a lucid overview of the traditional Jewish holidays as well as Israel Independence Day, the Ninth of Av fast and the Sabbath.

To illuminate the vital relationship between history and geographical conditions, W. Gordon East draws examples from ancient times to the mid&#x2013;twentieth century. He demonstrates that when we look at the physical conditions under which an event occurs, we find that "the particular characteristics of this setting serve not only to localise but also to influence part at least of the action." Topographical position, climate, distribution of water and minerals, the placement of routes and towns, and ease or difficulty of movement between districts and countries are among the factors which the historian must take into account.<br><br> Professor East's topics include the role of geography in international politics, the contribution of the geographer to the study of ancient civilizations, and the use of old maps as historical documents.</p><p>W. Gordon East was professor of geography at Brikbeck College, University of London.</p><h2>Ocean Birds of the Nearshore Pacific</h2><p>Oceans are the new frontier for birding. The natural history of the seas is increasingly popular with amateur as well as professional birders. Oceans are a vital part of our planet, covering 70% of its surface. Conservation of the sea&#39;s extraordinary and diverse life forms- which this book so richly describes- is of concern to us all. Rich Stallcup discusses how to identify pelagic birds, as well as marine mammals, turtles, and other ocean creatures with keen understanding and passion.</p><p></p><h2>Silver Packages: An Appalachian Christmas Story</h2><p>In this story of expectation and the transforming power of kindness, Frankie, an Appalachian boy, waits beside the train tracks for the Christmas train, which brings presents to children, in the hopes of receiving one very special gift.</p><p>As a child in West Virginia, Cynthia Rylant never dreamed of becoming a writer. In her free time, she devoured Archie comic books and paperback romances and enjoyed the outdoors. But after taking one college English class, she was, hooked on great writing I didn&#x2019;t know about this part of me until I went to college-didn&#x2019;t know I loved beautiful stories.&#x201d; And one night, inspired by the Southern writer James Agee, she sat down and wrote When I Was Young in the Mountains. Named a Caldecott Honor Book and an ALA Notable Book, it was an instant success.<br><br>Since that night, Rylant hasn&#x2019;t stopped creating wonderful books. Her stories explore friendship, love, grief, and other mysteries, and often draw on her memories of growing up in Appalachia. I get a lot of personal gratification thinking of those people who don&#x2019;t get any attention in the world and making them really valuable in my fiction-making them absolutely shine with their beauty.&#x201d;<br><br>She lives with her many pets in the Pacific Northwest.<br>Grade 1-4. Full-page watercolor paintings decorate this warm, sentimental story loosely based on actual events. Rylant traces the origins of an Appalachian "Christmas Train" that travels through the mountains each year on December 23 to a rich man who wished to repay a debt of kindness he had received many years before. He faithfully returns and tosses silver packages from the caboose to the coal-town children who wait by the tracks. One such child is Frankie, who longs for a doctor's kit every year; instead he gets much-needed socks or mittens along with small toys. As an adult, he moves back to the town to live and work, having fulfilled his dream of becoming a doctor. With her clear, balanced, and well-paced storyteller's voice, the author builds the anticipation and excitement that the children?and especially Frankie?feel at the train's annual arrival. Although the heroic profile of this child-turned-man makes him more of a symbol than a real person, his story is capably told. The illustrations provide panoramic views of the Appalachian countryside, with deep nighttime blues and wintry colors, strengthening the sense of place. A well-rendered reflection on the importance of giving and sharing.<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Book of Durrow /anglais</h2><p>The Book of Durrow is among the earliest surviving decorated manuscripts in north-western Europe, dating to the late seventh century AD. A masterpiece of Celtic art, it is believed to be the oldest fully decorated Insular Gospel that survives, pre-dating the Book of Kells by more than a century. Created in a monastery associated with the Irish saint Colum Cille (St Columba), its text and artwork reflect the formative years of a &#39;golden age&#39; of artistic production in Ireland and Britain. This richly decorated introductory guide explores the manuscript&#39;s distinctive artwork and tells the extraordinary story of its preservation in the Irish monastery at Durrow - first as sacred text then as relic - and its acquisition in the seventeenth century by the Library of Trinity College Dublin.

Eliot, W.H. Auden, and C.S. Lewis, for example, were among his great admirers. But those books - which include &#39;The Place of the Lion&#39; &#39;Descent into Hell&#39; and &#39;All Hallows&#39; Eve&#39; - are also dense and perplexing, and even the writer&#39;s fondest devotees have found the meanings of his fiction elusive. Here at last is a clear and informed guide to the complexities and rich rewards of Charles Williams&#39; novels. As Thomas Howard notes, Williams&#39; tales might best be described as metaphysical thrillers, in which Williams used occult machinery in much the same way that Conrad used exotic locales and Joyce used the subconscious: to vivify human experience and awaken readers to its range and possibilities. One tale might feature a chase for the Holy Grail across Hertfordshire fields, while in another the picture may switch with no apology at all from a policeman at a crossroad to the Byzantine Emperor. As Howard lucidly demonstrates, the controlling factor behind Williams&#39; work is an essentially Christian worldview in which heaven and hell seem to lurk under every bush and the constant theme is order versus disintegration. Concentrating on Williams&#39; novels, Howard brilliantly illuminates the major concerns that informed all of Williams&#39; thinking. Howard also considers Williams&#39; work in the context of modern fictional practice and assesses its place in the tradition of the English language novel.</p><p>Thomas Howard was a Professor of English and Literature for over 30 years.

What happened? Was it something we did--or didn't do? Was the child truly the philosophical being he once seemed? Gareth Matthews takes up these concerns in <i>The Philosophy of Childhood</i>, a searching account of children's philosophical potential and of childhood as an area of philosophical inquiry. Seeking a philosophy that represents the range and depth of children's inquisitive minds, Matthews explores both how children think and how we, as adults, think about them.</p><p>Adult preconceptions about the mental life of children tend to discourage a child's philosophical bent, Matthews suggests, and he probes the sources of these limiting assumptions: restrictive notions of maturation and conceptual development; possible lapses in episodic memory; the experience of identity and growth as "successive selves," which separate us from our own childhoods. By exposing the underpinnings of our adult views of childhood, Matthews, a philosopher and longtime advocate of children's rights, clears the way for recognizing the philosophy of childhood as a legitimate field of inquiry. He then conducts us through various influential models for understanding what it is to be a child, from the theory that individual development recapitulates the development of the human species to accounts of moral and cognitive development, including Piaget's revolutionary model.</p><p>The metaphysics of playdough, the authenticity of children's art, the effects of divorce and intimations of mortality on a child--all have a place in Matthews's rich discussion of the philosophical nature of childhood. His book will prompt us to reconsider the distinctions we make about development and the competencies of mind, and what we lose by denying childhood its full philosophical breadth.</p></p><p>&#39;The Philosophy of Childhood&#39; is a searching account of children&#39;s philosophical potential and of childhood as an area of philosophical inquiry.

One such mystery is the Genesis 6 account of giants on the earth. These giants &#39; the Nephilim &#39; were the vile offspring of earthly women and divine beings bent on the deception and destruction of God&#39;s holy people. History is about to repeat itself. Jesus said, &#39;As it was in the days of Noah, so it will also be in the days of the Son of Man&#39; (Luke 17:26). The Nephilim are coming again, positioning themselves to rule the world in degrees of wickedness such as man has never known. Are you ready&#39; Randy DeMain sheds light on biblical history and ancient texts recognized by God&#39;s people in the past, but closed for centuries. In The Nephilim Agenda you will learn: * What it was like in &#39;The days of Noah,&#39; and how the Nephilim re-infiltrated the earth after the flood * The Nephilim in Jesus&#39; time * How Nephilim spirits are involved in the earth today and their last days&#39; agenda But it&#39;s not all bad news! You will also learn: * How to recognize and be free from this ungodly influence! * How to prepare yourself mentally, emotionally, practically and spiritually! * The ultimate triumph of the Bride without spot or wrinkle! These are not days to withdraw or hide, rather days to overcome, to walk out the faith and hope that is in us! ABOUT THE AUTHOR Ministering the gospel for over 25 years, Randy DeMain has a deep passion for the body of Christ to come into the fullness of their identity and purpose in Christ. Randy&#39;s primary emphasis is restoring apostolic truth and practice in the lives of believers who attend his conferences and crusades. He is preparing the bride of Christ for the coming King.

(Macquarie), Ph.D. (Cambridge), BA Hons. (Ceylon), is a poet, novelist and author of studies of Jane Austen, Alexander Pope, Ruth Jhabvala and Leonard Woolf. Professor Gooneratne has been awarded honours including the Marjorie Barnard Prize for Fiction, India&#39;s Raja Rao Award for her outstanding contribution to the literature of the South Asian diaspora, and the Order of Australia for her services to literature and education.&#34;It is a pleasure to read Leonard Woolf&#39;s novel The Village in the Jungle in this new edition compiled by Yasmine Gooneratne. First of all, it makes good reading because the author, who was at the beginning of his writing career when he published it for the first time with Edward Arnold in London in 1913, displayed a strong and experienced voice with a convincing and persuasive literary style. The story takes the reader behind the orderly facade of colonial Ceylon to the rural milieu in which clashes of emotions and cultures occur. Secondly, it reveals the conflicts which the imperial power of Britain inflicted on an indigenous people, and which determined the lives and fortunes of many an individual torn between tradition and innovation. Succeeding the works of Rudyard Kipling and preceding those of Joseph Conrad and E.M. Forster, The Village in the Jungle occupies an important place in the history of English colonial literature... Yasmine Gooneratne presents a convincing scholarly edition of this classic of colonial literature. Being of Sri Lankan origin herself, she knows the setting of the plot from her own childhood experience; and as an experienced author of two postcolonial novels, A Change of Skies (1991) and The Pleasures of Conquest (1996), she possesses the necessary insights into the narratological and academic demands of such an enterprise. In her persuasive introduction she deploys all these skills, beginning by explaining to the reader the biographical background of Leonard Woolf, whose life was darkened by his wife&#39;s ill health while his life&#39;s work was overshadowed by her literary fame. She draws our attention to the novel&#39;s implied criticism of British imperial policy, and points out analogies with T.S. Eliot&#39;s famous poetical sequence The Waste Land (1922), which owes so much to Leonard Woolf&#39;s prophetic inspiration anticipating the destructive powers of the Great War. Her fresh evaluation of the symbolic strengths which underscore on a fictional level the gap of two narrative discourses, those of the colonial and postcolonial phases in recent British history, rightly locates Woolf&#39;s novel as an important text amidst Rudyard Kipling&#39;s Jungle Books, Joseph Conrad&#39;s Heart of Darkness and E.M. Forster&#39;s A Passage to India. In doing so she picks up on research lines of Basil Mendis, Peter Elkin and Mervyn de Silva, who had previously analysed the novel along critical assumptions now dated, her scholarly acumen and credo prompting her to return to the novel&#39;s source, i.e., to the 264-page manuscript which reposes in the steel safe of the Librarian of the University of Peradeniya in Sri Lanka. She conducted this archival research to mark the passages which vary substantially and significantly from the printed editions of the book, thus enabling the reader to observe and participate in the creative process which the author underwent in writing his novel... It would have been difficult for a Western reader to follow the plot of this intriguing novel without the understanding of certain Sinhala words and a knowledge of some indigenous myths. Yasmine Gooneratne, with her academic expertise in oriental and Western culture, guarantees the necessary insights into the intricate and conflicting traditions which meet in this novel. A comprehensive bibliography invites further research on this seminal book. This careful edition of The Village in the Jungle will, one hopes, restore the novel&#39;s literary reputation and help to establish its proper profile in the field of literary studies.&#34; - Professor Rudiger Ahrens, Institute of English and American Studies, University of Wurzburg, Germany &#34;The Village in the Jungle is a novel that should be far better known. One may hope that now, in this fully restored edition. it will find a readership moved by its carefully developed tragic narrative and challenged by its prescient political analysis. It is a fiction whose human drama is driven by the economic motor of imperial policy, its enforcement, its interests. self interests and murderous entanglements... One of the many benefits offered by this scrupulously annotated scholarly edition is that. by providing cancelled passages as well as other emendations and substitutions in the Notes, it enables us to watch the narrator in this act of disappearing. As one reads, one gradually enters a text that seems to be happening outside the narrator&#39;s earshot, beyond his power to influence or control. It becomes as a result a witness text by the voiceless. The village world, the jungle landscape are their own space, not symbols of the writer&#39;s metaphysical anxieties. The western presence is there, but only at the margins, in the brief appearances of the magistrate. Constructed directly out of Woolf&#39;s own experiences in that role, he is a reluctant but complicit imperial agent, what Woolf came to understand his own role to have been in the imperial system... In detail after detail, this remarkable novel&#39;s analysis of imperialism is grounded in the process of its repudiation.&#34; - (from the Foreword) Professor Judith Scherer Herz, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada &#34;Professor Yasmine Gooneratne has edited Leonard Woolf&#39;s novel with the meticulous care it deserves, taking into consideration the entire range of critical interpretations the text has generated in the ninety years of its existence. The extensive notes at the end provide useful textual as well as cultural information, and a fascinating Appendix brings to the notice of the reader a film version of The Village in the Jungle made in Sri Lanka and a somewhat curious reading of the novel by a recent biographer of Virginia Woolf who holds Leonard Woolf responsible for his wife&#39;s suicide. Complete with a detailed Introduction and an exhaustive bibliography, this is likely to become the definitive edition of this twentieth century classic. The novel may be a minor classic as far as mainstream English literature is concerned, but in the context of Sri Lanka it occupies a prominent position, somewhat similar to the position of E.M. Forster&#39;s A Passage to India in India. The two novels, written within a few years of each other, are both attempts by unusually perceptive British writers to understand the countries ruled by Britain. Both have been widely read and discussed in the respective countries, and often prescribed in courses of study. Leonard Woolf&#39;s novel has an elemental quality about it. The paradigmatic story of a simple village community disintegrating under the multiple assaults of &#39;civilization&#39;, inclement nature and hostile fate has been told in diverse ways in several non-Western cultures later in the century (e.g., Chinua Achebe&#39;s Thing.s- Fall Apart or Gopinath Mohanty&#39;s Paraja) but this book is unique in having been written by an &#39;outsider&#39; who had empathy with the village people as well as an ironic realization of the limitations of a colonial legal system (of which he himself was a part) in providing justice to them.&#34; - Professor Meenakshi Mukherjee, University of Hyderabad, India&#34;</p><h2>Hush (Johns Hopkins: Poetry and Fiction)</h2><p>Poems that tell of love, desire, parents, children, ecstasy, and death mark the debut of a powerful new American lyric voice</p><p></p><h2>Eat This ..

Pairing Charles Darwin and a rare species of barnacle as her unlikely protagonists, Rebecca Stott has written an absorbing work of history, a book that guides readers through the treacherous shoals of nineteenth-century biology. Beginning her narrative in the 1820s even before Darwin's <i>Beagle</i> voyage, Stott examines the mystery of why Darwin waited over two decades between formulating his pivotal theory of natural selection and publishing it. Lavishly illustrated, filled with riddles and concepts that challenge our notion of Victorian science, Darwin and the Barnacle is a thrilling account of how genius proceeds through indirectionand how one small item of curiosity contributed to one of science's greatest achievements. 32 illustrations.</p><p><b>Rebecca Stott</b> is an affiliated scholar in the Department of History and Philosophy of Science at Cambridge University.Who would ever guess that those funny little creatures called barnacles played an important part in the development of the theory of evolution? Charles Darwin was fascinated with barnacles for eight long years. If he had died in 1854, he would have been remembered as the author of a groundbreaking four-volume study of all the different shapes and sexual variants that these crustaceans exhibit. Darwin's meticulous investigation of the variations in species and morphology helped him to develop the analytical and descriptive skills he would apply when, a few years later, he took the short draft of his "species theory," as he called it, out of a locked drawer and expanded it into On the Origin of Species. Stott, a scholar in the history of science at Cambridge University, explains that Darwin's investigations could not have gone very far without the development in the 1840s and '50s of Britain's postal system, which depended on the expansion of the railroads, in turn dependent on smalltime speculators like Darwin, whose financial independence was based on his investments. Stott tells her story beautifully, but she takes a while to get going and occasionally dallies on tangential topics just when one wants to know what happened next. Readers will learn almost as much about England in the 1850s as about this crucial decade in Darwin's life.

Chris created the Free Cornish Army, invaded the country next door, and persuaded the UK media that Cornwall had risen up and declared independence. As he told the police at the time, 'It was only a small country, and I did give it back.'<br><br>Now he lives in rural France with his wife and a frightening number of animals. They grow their own food and solve their own crimes. The latter out of necessity when Chris's identity was stolen along with their life savings.

Frustration churned her stomach into a huge knot. <i>Where is Betsy McKay?</i> None of her lawenforcement contacts in Texas had panned out. She'd been sure that Betsy was in Austin or San Antonio, the two largest cities closest to Little Horn in the Texas Hill Country.<br><br>Lucy rose from behind her desk at the sheriff's office. She grabbed her cowboy hat from the peg on the wall, set it on her head and decided to go for a walk. She needed to work off some of this aggravation plaguing her ever since the series of robberies had started months ago in her county. She still hadn't been able to bring in the Robin Hoods, as the robbers had been dubbed since many gifts given to the poor in the area had mysteriously started not long after the cattle rustling and stealing of equipment began.<br><br>Stepping outside to a beautiful March afternoon, she paused on the sidewalk and relished the clear blue sky, the air with only a hint of a chill. They needed rain, but for the moment she savored the bright sunshine as a sign of good things to come.<br><br>She was closer to figuring out who the Robin Hoods were. They were most likely teenagers who were familiar with the area and ranch life. Of course, that described all the teenagers surrounding Little Horn. But there also seemed to be a connection to Betsy McKay. The ranches like Byron McKay's were the main targets. The owners of each place hit by the Robin Hoods hadn't helped Mac McKay when he needed it. Could this be mere coincidence? Mac's death, caused by his heavy drinking, had sent Betsy, his daughter, fleeing Little Horn her senior year in high school.<br><br>The Lone Star Cowboy League, a service organization formed to help its ranchers, could have stepped up and helped more, although Mac hadn't been a member. But even more, Byron McKay, the richest rancher in the area and Mac's cousin, should have helped Mac when he went to Byron for assistance.<br><br>Lucy headed toward Maggie's Coffee Shop to grab a cup of coffee, and then she had to come up with another way to find Betsy. As she neared the drugstore, the door swung open and Ben Stillwater emerged with a sack. His Stetson sat low on his forehead, and he wore sunglasses, hiding his dark brown eyes that in the past had always held a teasing twinkle in them.<br><br>But that was before he had been in a coma for weeks and struggled to recover from his riding accident. The few times she'd seen him lately, his somber gaze had held none of his carefree, usual humor. He had a lot to deal with.<br><br>Ben stopped and looked at her, a smile slowly tilting his mouth up as he tipped the brim of his black hat toward her. "It's nice to see you, Lucy. How's it going?"<br><br>"I'm surprised to see you in town."<br><br>"Why?" The dimples in his cheeks appeared as his grin deepened.<br><br>"You just got out of the hospital."<br><br>"Days ago. I'm not letting my accident stop me any more than necessary. I'm resuming my duties at the ranch. Well, at least part of them. I know that my foreman and my brother have done a nice job in my&#x2014;absence. But I'm home now, and you know me&#x2014;I can't sit around twiddling my thumbs all day."<br><br>For a few seconds, Lucy glimpsed the man Ben had once been, the guy who played hard and wouldn't stay long with any woman. He'd never been able to make a long-term commitment. How long would it take before he reverted to his old ways? Yes, he had been a good rancher and put in a lot of work at his large spread, but still, he had never been serious about much of anything except his ranch. And helping teens. "How's the Future Ranchers Program at your place going with your absence?"<br><br>"Zed and Grady have kept it going. I'd been working a lot with Maddy Coles, Lynne James and Christie Markham before the accident, so they knew what to do."<br><br>Maddy had been Betsy McKay's best friend while she'd lived here. Did she know where Betsy was and wouldn't say? "What are you doing in town?"<br><br>"Picking up my prescriptions. I had to get out of the house. I hate inactivity even if I have to work through some pain. I'm going stir-crazy, and I promised Grandma that I wouldn't go back to work until I'm home a week."<br><br>Again those dimples appeared in his cheeks. "What was I thinking? Only thirty-six hours, then I'm a free man."<br><br>"How's Cody doing?" She still couldn't believe that Ben was a father, although the DNA test that had come back could only state Cody was a Stillwater, a son either of Grady or Ben, identical twins. The eight-month-old was staying at the Stillwater Ranch, and Ben seemed to accept the fact he was the boy's dad since Grady had said the child couldn't be his. She'd always thought of Ben as a playboy, happiest with no ties to hold him down, but a baby could certainly do that.<br><br>Ben removed his sunglasses, his dark brown eyes serious. "A little man on the go. I think he knows the house better than I do."<br><br>She'd wanted to ask him about the letter, addressed to Ben, that she'd given Grady to give him. She'd found it in the wreck outside town where a young woman had died. Was she Cody's mother? What did it say? The words were on the tip of her tongue to ask him when she spied Byron heading for her.<br><br>Ben glanced at the tall man with a large stomach and wavy strawberry blond hair coming toward them. "He looks like he's on a mission."<br><br>"Yeah, I'm sure he is."<br><br>"Do you want me to stay?" Ben put his sunglasses on.<br><br>"No, he's my problem. You don't need the stress." The less others heard Byron's tirade the better she would feel. If she could escape, she would.<br><br>"But&#x2014;"<br><br>"I mean it. Listening to him is, sadly, part of my job. Take care."<br><br>Ben tipped his hat and strode toward his truck, pausing a moment to speak with Byron, who frowned and continued his trek toward her.<br><br>"Sheriff." Byron planted himself in Lucy's path. "What kind of progress have you made on the thefts occurring?"<br><br>"I have a few leads I'm following."<br><br>"Like what?" he demanded in a deep, loud voice.<br><br>Lucy glanced around, wishing this conversation could take place in her office, not on the main street of Little Horn. "I have a possible lead on where the cattle are being sold. Without brands, it's harder to track the stolen cows." The rustlers had stolen new cattle that hadn't been branded yet.<br><br>"Yeah, we all know the thieves know what's going on here. Maybe when you find them, we should elect one of them sheriff next year when you're up for reelection."<br><br>Heat singed her cheeks as a couple slowed their step on the sidewalk to listen to the conversation. "That would be a brilliant idea. Put the crooks in charge."<br><br>"Sarcasm doesn't become you. I help pay your salary, and I want to see this settled. Now."<br><br>The drugstore door opened, and Lucy looked to see who else would witness Byron's dressing-down. His twins, Gareth and Winston, came to a stop a few feet from their father. Winston's eyebrows slashed down while Gareth's expression hardened.<br><br>Holding up a sack, Winston moved forward. "Dad, we've got what we need for the school project. Ready to go?"<br><br>A tic twitched in Gareth's cheek, his gaze drilling into his father.<br><br>The twins weren't happy with Byron. Lucy couldn't blame them. He'd been going around town, ready to launch into a spiel with anyone who would listen about what should be done to the rustlers and why she wasn't doing her job. His ranch had been hit the hardest.<br><br>Her gaze swept from one twin to the other. Maybe the boys knew where Betsy was. She needed to talk to them without their father. Anytime the conversation turned to Mac or Betsy, Byron went off on one of his heated outbursts.<br><br>Byron nodded at his sons, then turned to her and said, "Think about when you run for sheriff next year. Do you want me as a supporter or an enemy?"<br><br>"Dad, we've got a lot of work to do tonight," Gareth said in an angry tone, then marched toward Byron's vehicle across the street.<br><br>Lucy watched Winston and Byron follow a few yards behind Gareth; the middle-aged man was still ranting about the situation to Winston, whose shoulders slumped more with each step he took. Did those twins have a chance with Byron as their father? They were popular, but stories of them bullying had circulated; unfortunately, nothing she could pursue. It wouldn't surprise her because Byron was the biggest bully in the county.<br><br>With long strides Lucy headed again for Maggie's Coffee Shop. She needed a double shot of caffeine because she would be spending hours tonight going over all the evidence to see if she'd missed anything.<br><br>Ben Stillwater sank into the chair on the back porch of his house at his ranch near Little Horn. He cupped his mug and brought it to his lips. The warm coffee chased away a chill in his body caused by the wind. To the east the sun had risen enough that its brightness erased the streaks of orange and pink from half an hour ago.<br><br>Ben released a long breath&#x2014;his first day back to work after his riding accident that had led to a stroke caused by a head injury at the end of October. He had gone into a coma, then when he had woken up, he'd faced a long road with rehabilitation. The accident seemed an eternity ago. He'd just discovered a baby on his doorstep, and he'd been on his way to Carson Thorn's house to figure out what to do when his world had changed. He couldn't believe months had been taken from him. An emptiness settled in his gut. He wasn't the same man.<br><br><i>So much has changed.</i><br><br><i>I have a son. Cody.</i><br><br><i>But who is Cody's mother?</i><br><br>He was ashamed he didn't know for sure. His life before the injury had been reckless, with him always looking for fun. Was the Lord giving him a second chance?<br><br>When he had come out of the coma, he didn't remember what had prompted him to go see his neighbor that day of the accident, a trip he'd never completed because his horse had thrown him and he'd hit his head on a rock. But lately he'd begun to recall the details. Finding the baby on his front doorstep. Holding the crying child. Reading the note pinned to the blue blanket with Cody's name on it. <i>Your baby, your turn.</i><br><br>Grandma Mamie had told him in the hospital the DNA test had come back saying Cody was a Stillwater, which meant either he was the father or his twin brother, Grady, was, and Grady knew the baby wasn't his. The news had stunned him.<br><br><i>That leaves me. I'm a father.</i><br><br>He'd known it when Grady and Grandma had brought Cody to the hospital to meet him. In his gut he'd felt a connection to the baby.<br><br>Grady had gone into town, but the second he was back they needed to talk finally. One last time he had to make sure his twin brother wasn't Cody's father before Ben became so emotionally attached to the baby he couldn't let him go. And if Grady wasn't Cody's father, then that brought Ben back to the question: Who was Cody's mother? He should know that.<br><br>He sipped his coffee and thought back to seventeen months ago. He'd been wild before his riding accident. He'd worked hard, and he'd played hard. Not anymore. He had a little baby to think of. Lying in that hospital, piecing his life back together, he'd come to the conclusion he couldn't continue as he had before, especially because of Cody.<br><br>The back door creaked open, and Ben glanced toward it. Grady emerged onto the porch with a mug in his hand. Although they were identical twins, when Ben had stared at himself in the mirror before he'd shaved this morning, he'd seen a pasty-white complexion that had lost all its tan since he was in the hospital. His features were leaner, almost gaunt. A shadow of the man moving toward him with a serious expression, his dark brown eyes full of concern.<br><br>"I'm not sure I want to ask what's wrong," Ben said as Grady folded his long body into the chair across from him.<br><br>"Grandma said you were talking to her about Cody and his parentage. Are you having doubts you're Cody's father?"<br><br>"Are you?"<br><br>"No," Grady said in a forceful tone. "I didn't really think it was your child."<br><br>"Why do you say that?"<br><br>"Because you're the serious twin. You're the one who does the right thing. I'm the rogue of the family. Everyone knows that. I was wondering more about who is Cody's mother. Sadly I don't know for sure. There's more than one woman it could be." Ben shrugged, then set his mug on the wicker end table near him. "Grandma said you had a letter for me."<br><br>Grady frowned. "She wasn't supposed to say anything. I was."<br><br>"I think y'all have waited long enough. I've been awake for weeks."<br><br>"Trying to recuperate from a stroke and head trauma. I didn't want to add to the problems you were facing with rehabilitation."<br><br>"I'm not fragile. I won't break, and I don't need protecting."<br><br>His twin started laughing. "You must be getting better. You're getting feisty and difficult." Grady reached into his back pocket and pulled out an envelope with Ben's name on it. "This is for you."<br><br>"Where did you get it?"<br><br>"The sheriff gave it to me for you."<br><br>"Lucy Benson? Where did she find it?" Why didn't she say anything to him the other day when they met in town? He intended to ask her that when he saw her.<br><br>"She found it on the front seat of a car involved in a wreck. The driver, Alana Peterson, died. There were also several bags with baby items in them on the floor."<br><br>Cody's mother was Alana? Ben had liked her and had had a lot of fun with her, but there had never been anything serious enough to lead to a marriage. He had a lot of mistakes to answer for. "When did this happen?"<br><br>"A week ago."<br><br>"You're just now getting around to it?"<br><br>"Yes." Handing the letter to Ben, Grady pinned his dark eyes on him and didn't look away.<br><br>Ben snatched it from his grasp but didn't open the envelope. If this was from Cody's mother, he would read it in private.<br><br>"Aren't you going to open it?"<br><br>"Later," Ben said while gritting his teeth.<br><br>"I know this is a lot to take in after all that has happened&#x2014;is happening&#x2014;but Chloe won't always be able to watch Cody."<br><br>"I figured when you two married she wouldn't be Cody's nanny for long. Y'all have your own life."<br><br>"She can for now, but she'll be having her own baby soon, and she wants to open a clinic. I want to see that dream come true for her," Grady said in reference to his fianc�e, who was pregnant with her ex-husband's baby.<br><br>"She should have that clinic. She's been a great physical therapist to work with. I can't avoid doing my exercises each day here at home since she lives here. And I know you'll be a good father to her child."</p><h2>Matisse: From Color to Architecture</h2><p>Traces the development of Matisse&#39;s art throughout the course of his sixty-year career, bringing together in a single volume both famous works and lesser-known pieces from the archives of his estate, in a study complemented by firsthand accounts by numerous participants in his Chapel of the Rosary and Le Cateau-Cambr�sis projects. 10,000 first printing.</p><p>Christian Brouder is a researcher at the CNRS, the national organization for scientific research, in Paris.</p><h2>Gears of War: The Slab</h2><p>MARCUS FENIX. WAR HERO. LOYAL SON. TRAITOR. <br><br>Ten years after Emergence Day, as the Locust Horde advances on humanity&#x2019;s last defended area&#x2014;Ephyra&#x2014;in a bloody war that has seen billions die, Marcus Fenix does the unthinkable: he defies orders and abandons his post during a critical battle in a bid to rescue his father, weapons scientist Adam Fenix. But Adam is buried in the rubble during a ferocious assault on the Fenix mansion, and Ephyra falls to the enemy. Marcus, grieving for a father everyone believes is dead, is court-martialed for dereliction of duty and sentenced to forty years in the Coalition of Ordered Government&#x2019;s brutal maximum security prison, known simply as the Slab. <br><br>But Adam is very much alive, snatched from the destruction by the elite Onyx Guard on Chairman Richard Prescott&#x2019;s orders. He&#x2019;s now a long way from home and in a prison of his own&#x2014;a COG doomsday bunker on the tropical island of Azura, a place hidden from the rest of Sera since the Pendulum Wars. His own guilty secret has been exposed: Adam knew the Locust existed deep below the surface of Sera long before Emergence Day, and were being driven from their tunnels by a lethal parasite known as the Lambent. Now he has to find a way to destroy the Lambent while the dwindling COG forces fight to hold back a growing Locust army that&#x2019;s threatening to overrun the city. <br><br>As Adam struggles to find redemption in his comfortable island jail, Marcus seeks his own atonement in the squalid, closed world within the Slab&#x2019;s granite walls. While Dom Santiago and Anya Stroud fight to get him released, ready to make any sacrifice to free him, Marcus gradually finds unexpected kinship among Sera&#x2019;s most dangerous criminals&#x2014;and a way to carry on his personal war against the Locust.</p><p>#1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling novelist, screenwriter, and comic book author <b>Karen Traviss</b> has received critical acclaim for her award-nominated Wess&#x2019;har series, as well as regularly hitting the bestseller lists with her <i>Star Wars</i>, <i>Gears of War</i>, and <i>Halo</i> work.

Frost Book, The</h2><p><p> A famous illustrator amd sporting artist, A.B. Frost is perhaps best known for his naturalistic hunting and shooting prints, scenes that capture the drama of the sport-a hunter poised to shoot and a dog on point-all elements masterfully integrated into a richly detailed woodland or marsh setting. </p> <p></p> <p>Frost chronicled aspects of America's cultural life for over five decades. From the late 19th to the early 20th centuries, his art appeared in the most popular books and publications of the time, including Harper's Weekly, Scibner's and Life magazines. Like all of his art, Frost's illustrations always envoked the very essence of a setting and its mood-whether depicting the hilarious escapades of the entire family cat or farm dog, or the serene pastoral lifestyle of his native northeast. </p> <p></p> <p>This survey of Frost's life and work encompasses his early work in book illustration for such authors as Theodore Roosevelt and Lewis Carroll, his long and productive years at Harper &amp; Brothers and Charles Scribner's Sons, and his collaboration with Joel Chandler Harris on the Uncle Remus and Brer Rabbit books, which have become classics of American literature and illustration. </p><p></p> <p>The author's research has revealed important information on Frost's years as a student with Thomas Eakins at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, as well as his association with Lewis Carroll. Frost's accomplishments have been broadened by many new sporting pictures and an important group of sketches for the Uncle Remus books.</p> <p></p> <p>With over 116 illustrations, including 56 in color, The A.B. Frost Book represents and up-to-date appraisal of Frost's life and art. </p></p><p><p>...Mr. Frost's sketches for the new edition of "Uncle Remus." They are delicious. No other word will do. Technically they exhibit the fine maturity of Mr. Frost's art, his tact in the handling of line, his fineness in matters of color, his skill in making his pen as eloquent as a brush and in giving to black and white designs the solidity and the variety of paintings in oil....They are fun incarnate....the most brilliant piece of humorous characterization which has been done in the history of American art.</p> New York Tribune, 1895<p></p>Henry M. Reed became interested in A. B. Frost in 1963, while working as an independent insirance agent</p><h2>HEAVEN IS FOR REAL FOR KIDS (International Edition): A Little Boy&#39;s Astounding Story of His Trip to Heaven and Back</h2><p><p><b>Heaven is for real, and you are going to like it!</b></p><p>Colton Burpo came back from his trip to heaven with a very important message: Jesus really, really loves children.&nbsp;In an effort to reach even more families with this eternally significant story, this runaway bestseller is now told from Colton&#x2015;kid to kids! Children will receive the same comfort and assurance that so many adults have received from the trade book.</p><p>Beautifully illustrated under Colton's direction, he shares his experiences in first person and comments on things that will be important to kids. A letter to parents is included to guide them as they talk to their children about heaven. Scripture along with a Q&amp;A section with answers from the Bible are also included in the book.</p></p><p><p>Todd Burpo is pastor of Crossroads Wesleyan and a volunteer fireman. He and his wife, Sonja, have four children: Colton is an active teenager; he has an older sister, Cassie; a younger brother, Colby; and a very special sister he met in heaven. Sonja Burpo is a busy mom and pastor's wife. A certified elementary teacher, Sonja is passionate about children's ministry and helping women work through the difficulty of miscarriage.</p>If you have a television, you&#x2019;ve probaly seen Colton Burpo, the boy who died and went to heaven, and then returned to tell about it. The original Heaven Is for Real (2010) spent time on the New York Times best-seller list, so not unexpectedly a spin-off for children is now available. One of the book&#x2019;s major problems is that nowhere does it mention how Colton got to heaven (i.e., how his appendix burst and he &#x201c;died&#x201d;), so young readers may wonder how it is that Colton knows &#x201c;Jesus really, really loves children!&#x201d; Told in first person, Colton&#x2019;s story also describes how he met John the Baptist, Samson, and his great-grandfather, among others. He had extensive conversations with God, and played with animals from dogs to lions. The introduction notes that art was done under Colton&#x2019;s direction to reflect what heaven looks like, which seems to mirror what you might find on cheap greeting cards. Biblical texts extend the art, and eight &#x201c;questions kids ask&#x201d; are appended. For instance, do we get wings in heaven? &#x201c;Colton clearly remembers wings.&#x201d; The original book&#x2019;s popularity may spark demand for this one.

We are not surprised, therefore, when his thriller picks the winner of a two-month war between the superpowers in Iran. There is a little suspense about whether Iran, fighting both "satans," will detonate an atomic bomb, and somewhat less about whether the U.S.S.R. will start chemical warfare. The narrative consists mainly of set pieces on back-and-forth desert fighting, flashing from one side to another and featuring some continuing characters. But all the characters are paper-thin and all sound equally earnest and boring. Interest is not sustained by the book's undeniable authenticity, which has all the style of a training manual. And confusion arrives with the authentic alphabet soup: lots of info about MRRs, RDEs, BDUs, etc. Coyle's prose is often clumsy, the chapter-head quotes (from Napoleon, Sherman et al.) are as pertinent as fortune cookies and the ending manages to be sentimental and ungrammatical at the same time.

These countries were eager to apply -- and transform -- a European-born modernism, and within a few decades, they captured international attention with an array of extraordinary buildings, exemplified by the Ministry of Education and Health in Rio de Janeiro and the Brazilian pavilion at the 1939 New York World's Fair. <br><br> The contributors to this insightful collection of essays (which grew out of a 2002 conference organized by the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the New School University) offer contemporary reflections that underline the importance of reexamining this almost forgotten work in light of the contemporary crisis in global architectural production. Each essay examines a particular aspect of the cultural transformation that took place in Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Venezuela, and Mexico. Among the topics explored are the influence of Le Corbusier on the region, the early work of Oscar Niemeyer, the roots of Mexican modernism and its radical transformation in the work of Luis Barrag�n, and the creative collaboration between Venezuelan architect Carlos Raul Villanueva and sculptor Alexander Calder.</p><p>Carlos Brillembourg established his architectural practice in Caracas, Venezuela, in 1980, and in 1984 founded Carlos Brillembourg Architects in New York. His award-winning work has appeared in the <i>New York Times Magazine, Architectural Record, House and Garden, Harper's Bazaar,</i> and elsewhere.</p><h2>The Catiline Conspiracy (SPQR II)</h2><p><p>It was a summer of glorious triumph for the mighty Roman Republic. Her invincible legions had brought all foreign enemies to their knees. But in Rome there was no peace. The streets were flooded with the blood of murdered citizens, and there were rumors of more atrocities to come. Decius Caecilius Metellus the Younger was convinced a conspiracy existed to overthrow the government-a sinister cabal that could only be destroyed from within. But admission into the traitorous society of evil carried a grim price: the life of Decius's closest friend...and maybe his own.</p></p><p><p><b>John Maddox Roberts </b>is the author of numerous works of science fiction and fantasy, in addition to his successful historical SPQR mystery series. <i>SPQR XIII: The Year of Confusion </i>was published in 2010. He lives in New Mexico with his wife.</p>Roberts ( SPQR ) again proves that he's perfectly at home in the urban sprawl of ancient Rome as his sleuth Decius Caecilius Metellus the Younger follows a trail of suspicious deaths to the heart of a dangerous conspiracy. When a banker and a building contractor are murdered in the street, Roman officials are disinterested. Although the second murder was clumsily amateurish, Decius suspects the murders are related and ominous portents of things to come: he also has stumbled on a cache of arms hidden in the Temple of Saturn. Well born but temporarily stuck in a low-level government job, Decius needs only to contrive a bit of grumbling at parties to gain a reputation as a malcontent--and an invitation to further his ambitions by joining Lucius Sergius Catilina's treasonous bid for power. As Decius pursues the investigation, his account is spiced with observations on Rome's politics and personalities. Readers familiar with the period will be entertained by passing references, such as to the posturing Julius Caesar or to young Catullus, fresh from the country and besotted with Clodia. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Culinaria: European Specialties</h2><p>Culinaria European Specialties invites the reader on a culinary journey through Europe with many stopovers: from Ireland in the west to Russia in the east, from Finland in the north to Turkey in the south.

But not just one head coach. A composite portrait is drawn through interviews with at least 20 current and former head coaches (including Super Bowl winners such as Bill Parcells, Tom Coughlin, Jimmy Johnson, Tony Dungy, Sean Payton, Mike Shanahan, Dick Vermeil, Mike Holmgren, Brian Billick, and Joe Gibbs), taking us through the professional and personal challenges of the job. This book covers the draft, free agency, big trades, training camp, family crisis, player troubles, coaching relationships with members of the staff, coach-owner dynamics, rivalries, Xs and Os, the playoffs--all the way to the Super Bowl.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just getting to Sunday is almost a relief for NFL head coaches. It's during that three-hour window 16 days a year when they can simply concentrate on what they do best, which is trying to win football games. But the job is, of course, much more than that.</p><p>GARY MYERS has covered the NFL for more than three decades. He is currently a football columnist for the New York Daily News. Myers is author of The Catch (Crown 2009) and cohost of YES Network&#39;s This Week in Football.FROM THE SUPER BOWL TO SUSPENDED<br><br>In mid-March 2012, Sean Payton was walking briskly through the hallway on the sixth floor of the NFL&#x2019;s midtown Manhattan headquarters at 345 Park Avenue. He was taking a quick break from a meeting with Commissioner Roger Goodell that was the equivalent to a student being called into the principal&#x2019;s office.<br><br>Payton had a card key in his left hand as he passed through a reception area on his way to a bathroom just beyond locked glass double doors. He stopped for a moment to chat with a familiar face and kept on going. The league had moved a few blocks uptown nine months earlier from its offices at 280 Park Avenue, where it did business during most of Paul Tagliabue&#x2019;s time as commissioner and Goodell&#x2019;s first five years.<br><br>The look on Payton&#x2019;s face didn&#x2019;t lie. He was worried.<br><br>&#x201c;Has Roger informed you of the discipline?&#x201d; he was asked.<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>He swiped the key, went through the glass doors, and two minutes later was passing back through the reception area on his return to Goodell&#x2019;s office. He was meeting with his professional executioner. It was barely two years since Goodell had handed him the Vince Lombardi Trophy after the New Orleans Saints&#x2019; feel-good Super Bowl victory over the favored Indianapolis Colts. Now Goodell was giving Payton one last chance to plead his case for leniency before he would hand out the first suspension of a head coach in the NFL&#x2019;s ninety-two-year history.<br><br>The reception area in the league&#x2019;s new office was state of the art. Payton glanced at the immense high-definition flat screen television with square panels. The picture covered almost an entire wall. Naturally, it was tuned to the NFL Network. If Payton had taken a seat on one of the leather couches and kept Goodell waiting just a few minutes, he could have seen himself as the lead story on the network&#x2019;s news updates. It was the second meeting between Payton and Goodell after an NFL investigation had uncovered one of the biggest scandals in league history. The Saints had been accused of setting bounties on opposing players for the previous three seasons, including their dramatic Super Bowl season of 2009. Payton hadn&#x2019;t been part of the bounty meetings, which the league said was run by defensive coordinator Gregg Williams and funded by Williams and the players, but he had gotten himself into deep trouble by not putting an end to it when he was told the league was investigating in 2010 and then not being forthcoming about what he knew in his initial meeting with the league investigators in New York in 2012. Goodell demands honest answers to questions.<br><br>Payton must have felt that the Lombardi Trophy, which he said he slept with and joked that he slobbered on the night the Saints won the championship, made him bulletproof. The Saints were aware the league was investigating them shortly after the Super Bowl, but Payton was intoxicated with success and the league felt he ignored its warnings. If Payton could not control Williams, he could have fired him. His self-importance came through in the first meeting in New York, when he spoke with league security. He was spitting smokeless tobacco into a Styrofoam cup. It&#x2019;s a good thing Goodell was not present for that portion of the meeting or he would have tossed him out of the office and personally escorted him onto Park Avenue.<br><br>No one person is bigger than the league. It doesn&#x2019;t matter if you are at the head of the class in the next generation of great coaches, already have won a Super Bowl ring, make $5 million a year, and helped in the healing process of one of the great natural disasters in the country&#x2019;s history. The NFL will not let its $9 billion a year business be brought down by a group of renegade coaches and players.<br><br>Payton had become one of the faces of the league after the Saints did their part in helping the city of New Orleans get over the devastation of Hurricane Katrina that ravaged the Big Easy in 2005 one year before he arrived. Until then, Payton was known for being a scab quarterback for the Chicago Bears during the twenty-four-day players strike in 1987, being close friends with Jon Gruden, and doing good work as the Giants&#x2019; offensive coordinator when they went to the Super Bowl in 2000 but then being run out of New York by Jim Fassel two years later when he was demoted from his play-calling duties. If it&#x2019;s true that things eventually work out for the best if you keep working hard, leaving New York and going to work for Bill Parcells when he was hired as the Dallas head coach in 2003 was the best thing that ever happened to Payton. They had no connection other than that they had worked for the Giants at different times. They hit it off right away.<br><br>Having Parcells on his r�sum� was a good thing for Payton. Just one season with the Cowboys had put him in position to be offered the Raiders&#x2019; head coaching job by Al Davis. But the Raiders had become a burial ground for coaches, and Payton turned down Davis and kept building his portfolio working for Parcells. He had been instrumental in recruiting Tony Romo to sign with the Cowboys as a free agent after he went undrafted in 2003 and then played a big role in his development that led to Parcells benching Drew Bledsoe early in the 2006 season and elevating Romo to the starting quarterback job. By then, Payton was in New Orleans and had tried and failed to acquire Romo in a trade shortly after he took the Saints job and before signing Drew Brees as a free agent.<br><br>Payton had an edge to him that Parcells loved, and they did have some things in common. Parcells lost both his parents during the 1983 season with the Giants. Payton lost his mother during the 2002 season with the Giants. Fassel had given him the play-calling duties after his own mother died in 1999. He took the play-calling responsibilities back just eleven days after Payton&#x2019;s mother died. Payton, who previously had lost his dad, considered Parcells a father figure. Parcells has three daughters and treated Payton like the son he never had. It was Payton&#x2019;s confidence that allowed him to turn down the Raiders job; he knew that if he stuck with Parcells, a better opportunity would come his way. Two years later, after the 2005 season, he interviewed in Green Bay and New Orleans. He was crushed when the Packers hired Mike McCarthy, the 49ers&#x2019; offensive coordinator. That was the job Payton wanted, and he got the news from Packers general manager Ted Thompson while he was in New Orleans interviewing with the Saints. But he could have the Saints job if he wanted it. At the time, it was far from the most attractive spot in the league. The city was still trying to rebuild after Katrina, and the Saints were coming off a 3&#x2013;13 season in which they spent the year based in San Antonio and played all their games on the road.<br><br>It was Payton&#x2019;s belief in himself and his arrogance, a trait that later would betray him, that led him to accept the ultimate coaching challenge. He packed up his young family from a beautiful suburb in Dallas where they were very happy and moved to New Orleans, where reminders of Katrina and the havoc it had caused were all around. In his first season, Payton had the Saints in the NFC championship game, where they lost to the Bears in Chicago. Considering how far the Saints had come in one year, it was a tremendous achievement. By his fourth season, he won the Super Bowl, just as his mentor Parcells did in his fourth season with the Giants.<br><br>Payton needed his second trip to New York to be more productive than his first when the league had summoned him and Saints general manager Mickey Loomis to headquarters without telling them why. They knew the league had reopened the bounty investigation, but the invitation was not specific. They were caught off guard when they were peppered with questions from the NFL&#x2019;s security department when they met individually in a conference room down the hall from Goodell&#x2019;s office. The security staff shared some of the evidence it had gathered with Payton and Loomis. Goodell was not in the meeting, but after the security staff finished each interview, Goodell was brought in to speak with Payton and Loomis one on one. There had been talk around the NFL that after he won the Super Bowl, Payton was so full of himself it was bordering on unbearable and now he didn&#x2019;t appear credible when he denied knowledge of what was going on in the defensive meeting room.<br><br>Payton had his hand in everything related to his team, and the league found it hard to believe that something that was so blatantly in violation of NFL rules was going on in his building and he had no idea. Paul Hicks, the league&#x2019;s executive vice president of communications and public affairs, kept a copy of Payton&#x2019;s book Home Team: Coaching the Saints and New Orleans Back to Life, which Payton wrote after the Saints won the Super Bowl. Hicks and one of his staff members went through it and took notes on passages where Payton discusses his attention to detail. Hicks then reported back to Goodell, who had not read the book. The commissioner asked several sources he trusted how likely it was that Payton was in the dark while Williams and the defensive players were setting bounties on some of the biggest names in the league. The conclusion was that Payton had to have known what Williams was doing even if he was trying to distance himself from Williams, because nothing happened with his football team without his knowledge.<br><br>Payton had requested this second meeting with Goodell. They had spoken on the phone several times. Payton asked if they could get together while Goodell was in Florida attending committee meetings in advance of the league meetings later that month in Palm Beach. But Goodell was going to be tied up with the committees, so Payton arranged to come back to New York the next week. Saints owner Tom Benson was also in the league offices that day but met separately with Goodell. Payton was casually dressed for the occasion in a sport shirt and a pair of slacks. After returning from the men&#x2019;s room, he settled back into Goodell&#x2019;s office for another thirty minutes of trying to explain himself. The commissioner was beyond angry. He is a man of principle, an admirable trait passed down from his father. His mission was to make the game safer for the players, and here was Williams running a system that encouraged players to hurt other players; players committing unforgivable player-on-player crimes when they were supposed to be a fraternity that played hard but clean; and the head coach, a Super Bowl winner, not stopping it. Other than players or coaches betting on games, which would destroy the integrity of the league, it doesn&#x2019;t get much worse than players trying to hurt one another in a game that is already ultraviolent. It was now clear to the league that the Saints&#x2019; strategy was to pin the blame on Williams, who had left after the 2011 season.<br><br>Payton couldn&#x2019;t have felt good as he looked around Goodell&#x2019;s corner office, which overlooked Fifty-First Street and Park Avenue. It&#x2019;s a big office, not as big as the one he had at 280 Park but plenty large enough to have a desk on one side and a conference table on the other side. There is a big screen television to the right of a desk surrounded by photos and books. There&#x2019;s a collection of footballs. On one wall is a copy of the Congressional Record. Goodell&#x2019;s father, Charles Goodell, was a congressman from upstate New York when he was appointed by Governor Nelson Rockefeller to fill a U.S. Senate seat after the assassination of Robert Kennedy. He took office two months after Kennedy&#x2019;s death. Goodell was a Republican. Kennedy was a Democrat. As Kennedy&#x2019;s replacement, Goodell angered President Richard Nixon and Vice President Spiro Agnew with his opposition to the Vietnam War. The Congressional Record means a lot to Roger Goodell. It contained the original copy of Bill S. 3000, sponsored by Charles Goodell, which proposed an end to the funding for the war.<br><br>The administration targeted him as a turncoat, a Republican turned liberal. Agnew called him the Christine Jorgensen&#x2014;famous for a sex change operation from male to female&#x2014;of the Republican Party. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re five boys; we&#x2019;re a pretty tight-knit group,&#x201d; Roger Goodell said. &#x201c;Somebody attacks your father, you&#x2019;re upset. The five of us were ready to go. My father would always laugh it off. It never got under his skin. He would understand that he was being attacked politically, but he never took it personally. The Goodell boys did.&#x201d;<br><br>Charles Goodell&#x2019;s stance on the war wound up costing him the Senate seat. He had the nomination of the Republican and Liberal parties in 1970 but split the liberal vote with Democrat Richard Ottinger, allowing the conservative James Buckley to win. &#x201c;It was difficult on one level, but it was educational and important from a principle standpoint,&#x201d; Roger Goodell said. &#x201c;He stood up for what he believed in regardless of the consequences. He knew what the consequences were going to be.&#x201d;<br><br>Charles Goodell died in 1987. He was just sixty years old. By then, his son was working in the NFL office after a massive job-seeking letter-writing campaign&#x2014;he bombarded league executives with more than forty letters&#x2014;that wound up getting him an entry-level job, stopping the letters and rewarding his perseverance. Roger Goodell had long ago told his father of his career goal. He wanted to be the commissioner of the NFL.<br><br>As Payton sat at the big conference table, he could catch a glance over his shoulder at the reason Goodell was so infuriated. It was the reason he should not count on leniency. Mounted on the wall was a metal replica of the NFL shield. Goodell is consumed with his responsibility to protect the shield. The Saints and Payton had done huge damage to the shield. Any degree of contrition Payton would show would be measured against his motive: Was he saying things Goodell wanted to hear so that Goodell would go easier on him when he decided on the discipline?<br><br>The culture of the team had gone way off course. The Saints thought they were above NFL rules and were trying to set their own. They were sticking it in the league&#x2019;s face after being told in 2010 that NFL investigators were on to them. Everything that happens with a football team is the responsibility of the head coach. That goes for everything from calling for the game-changing onside kick to start the second half of the Super Bowl against the Colts that had Parcells raving about Payton&#x2019;s &#x201c;balls&#x201d; to being aware that your defensive coordinator has set up a system to reward players $1,000 for &#x201c;cart-offs,&#x201d; when the opposing player is carried off the field, and $1,500 for &#x201c;knockouts,&#x201d; which sidelined them for the rest of the game. The league&#x2019;s investigation revealed the pool might have reached $50,000 or more at its height during the 2009 playoffs and that linebacker Jonathan Vilma in 2009 offered $10,000 to anybody who knocked Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner out of the NFC divisional round or Vikings quarterback Brett Favre out of the NFC championship game. Warner was crushed after throwing an interception as he ran to make the tackle early in the second quarter but remained in the game through three quarters, when the Cardinals trailed by 35 points. Favre took every snap but absorbed several vicious hits. The Saints won the game in overtime.</p><h2>Resurrection Morning</h2><p><p>How would you respond if you had watched Jesus die and rise again? Max Lucado brings to life the reaction of one of the Roman soldiers who was assigned to Golgotha and what he saw that resurrection morning while guarding Jesus&#x2019; tomb. The soldier&#x2019;s search for answers about Jesus will resonate with children and adults alike. Accompanied by striking full-color illustrations, Lucado&#x2019;s story powerfully shows Christ&#x2019;s power to impact people&#x2019;s lives.</p></p><p>With text taken from Lucado's book Tell Me the Story, this repackaged illustrated gift book is intended as an Easter yarn for all ages. The story is told from the point of view of a Roman soldier assigned to guard Jesus' tomb after his burial. He and his companion think this is going to be an easy assignment, and actually doze off while on duty, only to awaken violently as an earthquake rocks the ground beneath the tomb. After the stone at the entrance miraculously rolls away, the soldiers are temporarily blinded by a sudden roar of light emanating from the tomb. After the tumult, one of the soldiers seeks out Jesus' companions to discover the truth about the risen man's life and mission.

John Rebus&#39;s reputation precedes him, and his bosses don&#39;t want him anywhere near Presidents Bush and Putin, which explains why he&#39;s manning an abandoned police station when a call comes in. During a preconference dinner at Edinburgh Castle, a delegate has fallen to his death. Accident, suicide, or something altogether more sinister? And is it linked to a grisly find close to the site of the gathering? Are the world&#39;s most powerful men at risk from a killer? While the government and secret services attempt to hush the whole thing up, Rebus knows he has only seventy-two hours to find the answers.</p><p>Ian Rankin is a #1 international bestselling author. Winner of an Edgar Award and the recipient of a Gold Dagger for fiction and the Chandler-Fulbright Award, he lives in Edinburgh, Scotland, with his wife and their two sons.James Gales Scottish brogue and intensity of emotion combine for a strong portrayal of Detective Inspector John Rebus, who is trying to solve the serial murders of recently released sex offenders and resolve his brothers death, all against the backdrop of the G8 summit being held outside Edinburgh. As if thats not bad enough, the G8 has the powers-that-be pulling rank and declaring that the death of the Assistant Minister of International Development is a suicide. Rebus doesnt agree and adds one more murder to his already full plate. Gale easily swings into a number of accents, leads listeners through the mlange of politics and suspense, and keeps the many characters sorted out, but listeners new to the series may struggle to keep up.

I lifted my nose into the icy breeze that rushed past me through the open window of the bus. The moon was hidden behind a thin barrier of clouds, but I felt it. Its weight pressed me with a sensuous, almost sexual, insistence. It reached for the wolf beneath my skin. I started at the realization that all sound had stopped in the bus. Just moments ago it had been a party on wheels with liquor flowing freely among the poker and dice games. Now, as the bus reached the edge of the park near Wolf Lake, the others began to snuffle and writhe. A woman's high pitched whine made me shiver.<br><br>A deep voice like liquid velvet reached my ears. "Soon, my wolves. Very soon I will let the moon take you." <br><br>I glanced to the front of the bus. Nikoli Molotov's eyes glowed yellow, revealing the effort he was expending. He had told me he would use the Sazi magic inside him to keep the pack members from turning to their animal shapes until we were well within the state park. But the thin shell of magic could barely contain the power that welled up inside of me. I felt like an overripe fruit, threatening to burst through my own skin.<br><br>This was my first full moon since moving to Chicago. There are few actual wooded areas here, and none that aren't accessible to the public. Still, I was told that the lakes and the parks can be sealed with magic so that no humans would want to enter while the pack hunts the animals native to the park. I'd never been hunting with a pack. Until recently, I'd only known of one werewolf besides myself - the one who'd turned me.<br><br>Who'd have believed that there were real werewolves among us in modern society? I certainly hadn't. I'd spent my first Sazi year in partial denial. I sealed myself away each month so I could turn into a wolf at will in the privacy of a private hotel suite. I hadn't tried to find others like me. I hadn't wanted to. Until I met Sue, I had pretended - had hoped - that this disease would just go away.<br><br>The hissing of the air brakes interrupted my thoughts. The whines and whimpers around me brought a deep throated growl from my throat. The magic roiling through the close confines of the bus was stifling. You could walk on the tension. The scent of musk and fur was overpoweringly sweet. It was hard to breathe. My muscles were twitching in earnest now. At the front of the bus, Nikoli smiled.<br><br>"Come, my wolves," he whispered. "It is time. Join the hunt." He exited the bus. We followed in his wake. I scanned the area with my vision pink-hazed from blood. I fought not to howl. Shuddering, I pulled the clothes from my body, reveling in the feel of the wind against my overheated skin. My eyes moved constantly, watching the others - my pack.<br><br>Some of the men had to turn their eyes away from the lithe nude forms of the women in the group, but I felt nothing for them. My mate was elsewhere. I glanced past the sign identifying the William. W. Powers State Conservation Area. In the distance, I smelled the sharp hot and sour soup scent of abject fear. I quickly wiped a small line of spittle from the side of my mouth. I tried to appear composed but it was a lie.<br><br>"So, how does this wor . . .?" I began, when Nikoli interrupted.<br><br>"Let the hunt begin!" he boomed and released the magical shield protecting me. The moon's force struck me like a sharp blade, shattering my control and sending me to my knees. I screamed in pain as a thousand pinpoints of light and magic erupted from my skin. Fur raced over my body and twisted my limbs. A full-grown, hungry wolf leapt out from inside me. I couldn't have stopped it if I wanted to. <br><br>I didn't want to.<br><br>The world suddenly shifted. Color disappeared, giving way to a thousand shades of grey and black. I stood on four feet, basking in the finger of moonlight that pried its way through the cloud cover. Beside me were over a dozen snarling wolves. I'd met one or two of them as humans. I couldn't tell who they were as wolves by sight, but my nose knew. Human or wolf, their scent was the same. I scanned the group for the leader of the pack. He wasn't hard to find. I felt my eyes go wide.<br><br>Nikoli had transformed into a huge black timber wolf. He easily stood three foot high at the shoulder. The only white on him was two spots on his knees. They glared like headlights in the darkness beneath the amber lights in his eyes. I realized that I didn't own a gun big enough to defend myself had I met him in the woods as a human. Not a comforting thought.<br><br>A single howl rent the night, quickly joined by other voices. The sounds were deep and throaty, not at all the high-pitched yelp of a coyote. <br><br>I felt the lips pull back from my fangs in a smile. Until I'd mated, my nights as a wolf had been lost to me. My thoughts inhuman, memories nonexistent. The difference is phenomenal. Now wolf or man - I'm me. That's thanks to Sue. I could feel fragments of her warmth and anticipation in the back of my mind. I knew she would be enjoying every minute of this new experience. The thought of the hunt was getting my mate turned on. <br><br>I like that in a woman. <br><br>She had believed in and accepted the mating bond even before I did. The sex had been incredible from the start. Not surprising since we can feel each other's pleasure through the bond. Still, I had struggled and fought the tie between us. I hadn't wanted to give up what I believed was my identity. But when she was dying of a gunshot wound, I made my choice. I accepted the bond, accepted the fact that we are truly a part of one another - just in time to have them cut me off from her for weeks while she's been healing in Colorado. It's a struggle now to share our thoughts, and I can't sense what she's doing at all. I hate it. I miss her. I want her home with me. <br><br>One of the wolves spoke. It's still weird hearing human speech coming from a furred muzzle. "Where's dragon lady tonight, Nikoli?"<br><br>A decidedly evil chuckle erupted from the black wolf. His eyes turned and locked on mine. "Our lovely Asri did not trust herself to ride on the bus and attend the pack meeting around our newest acquisition."<br><br>Now, what the hell did that mean?<br><br>"Which brings me to business," he continued. "Let us all please welcome our newest member of the pack. Anton, please step forward." <br><br>I sighed. I had tried repeatedly to get my new pack leader, a former member of Czar Nicholas II's court, to call me Tony. That's me, Tony Giodone, former high-end assassin, catering to both the paying public and the mob. I'm good enough to have never been caught. But a stupid mistake on my last job caused me to go underground and assume a new - or more precisely - a former identity. Here in Chicago, I'm Joe Giambrocco. But Nikoli keeps Russian-lizing everything. I'd finally decided that Anton was better than Yosef, if I was going to be stuck with a Russian name.<br><br>I stepped forward and the other wolves parted like water to let me pass, reforming in a circle around me and Nikoli. I stopped a few inches short of his muzzle and looked up into his face. He towered over me. His yellow eyes narrowed, as he watched me coldly. I stood steady, giving no sign of fear, despite the muscles rippling under his sleek black fur. <br><br>"You are Sazi," he said. "Blood of my blood. But to be of my pack, you must swear fealty to me and mine. You must give of yourself so that the others will recognize you as brother."<br><br>This was starting to make me nervous. It's one thing to be part of a club, but another thing entirely to swear some sort of blood oath.<br><br>I felt my eyes narrow, "Just what are you asking me to do?"<br><br>Nikoli smiled, baring fangs. His scent changed, but I couldn't pinpoint what he was feeling. I'd have to go by his words alone. <br><br>"I rule here. You will accept my authority over you. Yes?"<br><br>I had no problem with that. "I accept your authority as the pack leader. Yes."<br><br>"Excellent." I had just turned to leave when I froze completely. I literally couldn't move. I felt a flash of panic in the back of my mind that wasn't mine. Sue knew something I didn't, but it was a struggle to keep connected with her. The magic that flooded my body and mind was overwhelming. It was a pounding ache with sharp edges. <br><br>Nikoli stalked toward me. His lips had pulled back even further to reveal pink gums.<br><br>"Then know my power, whelp." He came at me in a rush of fangs and fur. I could do nothing to defend myself. He bowled me over and his teeth found my neck. A flash of pain seared my mind as his fangs broke through skin and I was thrown bodily to the ground. But the pain washed away as quickly as it began. My mind was floating suddenly as a wave of magic filled me. Suddenly, I could hear his voice in my mind. It was as thick and sweet as honey.<br><br>"You are pack of my pack, young one," said the voice. I knew I was bleeding, but I couldn't seem to feel it. I could hear Sue trying to call to me. It was a struggle to hear her.<br>f0The liquid baritone continued. "You will live for me, through me, and we all will live for you. We will protect you and you will always be fed. Be now one with the Sazi, Anton."<br><br>I came to myself with a dozen noses sniffing my head. I abruptly remembered part of my training on Carmine and Linda's island after Sue's near-death. One of the Sazi psychiatrists explained that the packs only functioned in the modern world because one person can control the individual wolves. <br><br>"If individual wolves were autonomous," Dr. Betty had said, "The world would quickly learn of us. Close to the moon, most lesser wolves can't control themselves when prey is near. Humans were once prey to our kind. Now if we were to attack them, it would be war. The humans would slaughter us. People always destroy that which they fear. Only by having a leader strong enough not to be affected by the moon ca...</p><h2>The Beet Queen (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)</h2><p>Orphaned fourteen-year-old Carl and his eleven-year-old sister, Mary, travel to Argus, North Dakota, to live with their mother&#39;s sister, in this tale of abandonment, sexual obsession, jealousy, and unstinting love</p><p><p>On a spring morning in 1932, young Karl and Mary Adare arrive by boxcar in Argus, North Dakota.

She also edited an annual anthology called <b>Sword and Sorceress</b> for DAW Books. </p><p> Over the years she turned more to fantasy; The House Between the Worlds, although a selection of the Science Fiction Book Club, was "fantasy undiluted". She wrote a novel of the women in the Arthurian legends -- Morgan Le Fay, the Lady of the Lake, and others -- entitled <b>Mists of Avalon</b>, which made the NY Times best seller list both in hardcover and trade paperback, and she also wrote <b>The Firebrand</b>, a novel about the women of the Trojan War.

Early one autumn afternoon in pursuit of an elusive book on her shelves, Susan Hill encountered dozens of others that she had never read, or forgotten she owned, or wanted to read for a second time. The discovery inspired her to embark on a year-long voyage through her books, forsaking new purchases in order to get to know her own collection again. A book which is left on a shelf for a decade is a dead thing, but it is also a chrysalis, packed with the potential to burst into new life. Wandering through her house that day, Hill&#39;s eyes were opened to how much of that life was stored in her home, neglected for years. &#34;Howard&#39;s End is on the Landing&#34; charts the journey of one of the nation&#39;s most accomplished authors as she revisits the conversations, libraries and bookshelves of the past that have informed a lifetime of reading and writing.</p><p>Susan Hill is the winner of numerous prestigious literary awards. She is the author of a highly successful crime series (Overlook Press) as well as the famous <i>The Woman in Black</i>, the stage production of which has been running internatoinally for years.*Starred Review* One day British novelist Susan Hill went to the bookshelves in her home looking for a copy of Howards End. She didn&#x2019;t find it (at least not at first), but she did come upon several other books she had never read. That started her thinking: Why not devote a year&#x2019;s reading time just to the books on her own shelves? The project launched, she began a systematic browse through all the books in her house (it&#x2019;s an old house with lots of floors and shelves on every floor, not to mention the landings between floors). This delightful bibliophile&#x2019;s memoir records her experience, both the browsing and the reading. Along the way, she developed a kind of second project: If she could only keep 40 books, which ones would they be? The list of 40 appears at the end, and it&#x2019;s a charmingly eccentric batch of books, but the real fascination in reading Hill&#x2019;s ruminations isn&#x2019;t about the list but, rather, about how she reads and how living with books enriches her life. Those who collect books in any fashion will be lost in their own memories as Hill muses on &#x201c;things that fall out of books,&#x201d; or defends writing in books, or, best of all, argues against overorganizing the books on her shelves (no more wonderful surprises). Just try to read this book without nosing around your own shelves. --Bill Ott</p><h2>How Early America Sounded</h2><p><p>"My hope is that by attending to sound I have been able to open up parts of these worlds, not to get a glimpse of them but to listen in. These were worlds much more alive with sound than our own, worlds not yet disenchanted, worlds perhaps even chanted into being."&#x2015;from the Introduction</p><p>In early America, every sound had a living, willful force at its source. Sometimes these forces were not human or even visible. In this fascinating and highly original work of cultural history, Richard Cullen Rath recreates in rich detail a world remote from our own, one in which sounds were charged with meaning and power.</p><p>From thunder and roaring waterfalls to bells and drums, natural and human-made sounds other than language were central to the lives of the inhabitants of colonial America. Rath considers the multiple soundscapes shaped by European Americans, Native Americans, and African Americans from 1600 to 1770, and particularly the methods that people used to interpret and express their beliefs about sound. In the process he shows how sound shaped identities, bonded communities, and underscored&#x2015;or undermined&#x2015;the power of authorities.</p><p>This book's stunning evidence of the importance of sound in early America&#x2015;even among the highly literate New England Puritans&#x2015;reminds us of a time before a world dominated by the visual, a young country where hearing was a more crucial part of living.</p></p><p>"As it moves from natural sounds to sounding boards to fiddles and finally to the rants of early Quakers and acoustics of meeting houses, Richard Cullen Rath&#x2019;s book grows in persuasiveness and argumentative force. How Early America Sounded is a valiant text which stands alone in the diverse fields that it touches."&#x2014;Robert Blair St. George, University of Pennsylvania <p>"Richard Cullen Rath&#x2019;s study of early American soundways is delightfully original, genuinely new, and always innovative. This is an exciting book of exceptional scholarly merit."&#x2014;Mark M. Smith, author of Listening to Nineteenth-Century America </p><p>"What did the world of the early American colonists sound like? The native peoples and colonists alike were very much tuned in to their auditory world. Richard Cullen Rath&#x2019;s How Early America Sounded is a fascinating account of what might be called aural history. In our postmodern &#x2018;plugged-in&#x2019; world, we archive sounds as photographs and video capture pictorial history, but as Rath points out, something has been lost, too. Think of this book as a going back to Walden Pond, but with one&#x2019;s ears wide open."&#x2014;Ron Hoy, Cornell University</p><p>Richard Cullen Rath is Associate Professor of History at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.</p></p><h2>Art of Clay: Timeless Pottery of the Southwest</h2><p>Major south-western American potters whose works are collected worldwide are represented here.

Now the biography is available for the first time in a lively and accessible abridgment by the author. This is the quintessence of Shaw. The narrative has a new verve and pace, and the light and shade of Shaw's world are more dramatically revealed as Holroyd counterpoints the private and public Shaw with inimitable insight and scholarship.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Playwright, wit, socialist, polemicist, vegetarian, and irresistible charmer, Bernard Shaw was the most controversial literary figure of his age, the scourge of Victorian values and middle-class pretensions. Born in Dublin in 1856, he grew up there, a lonely child in an unsettling m�nage � trois. His father, George Carr Shaw, had turned to drink, and his mother was muse to a Svengali-like music teacher whom she followed to London. The young Shaw, anxious to escape his heritage, also left for London to reinvent himself as the legendary G.B.S.--novelist, lover, politician, music critic, and finally playwright. From his first passionate affair with a beautiful middle-aged widow, he moved on to flirtations and liaisons with young actresses and socialists before finally settling into marriage in 1898.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the turn of the century, Shaw was in his prime, a theatrical impresario and author of those great campaigning plays--Man and Superman, Major Barbara, The Doctor's Dilemma, and John Bull's Other Island--that used laughter as an anesthetic for the operation he performed on British society. By 1914 the author of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pygmalion was the most popular writer in England, and increasingly recognized throughout Europe and America. Though ready with advice to others on how to stay married, he fell painfully in love with two of the most dazzling actresses of the age, Ellen Terry and Mrs. Patrick Campbell.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reluctant recipient of a Nobel Prize for literature and an Academy Award for his screenplay for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pygmalion, Shaw became an international icon between the two world wars, feted from China and Soviet Russia to India and New Zealand, though still contriving to provoke the establishment in the United States, South Africa, and Ireland. In old age he was vigorous and prolific, espousing many new and quixotic causes. He&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; revealed himself increasingly as conjurer, fabulist, and seer through his powerful late works, including Saint Joan, the Chekhovian Heartbreak House, the modernist fantasy Back to Methuselah, and the imaginative dream plays and political extravaganzas.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Covering almost a century, from 1856 to 1950, this unparalleled life of Shaw presents the magnificent&nbsp;&nbsp; double portrait of an age and of a man who was born fifty years too soon. Holroyd magically captures the essence of Shaw's protean genius in a tragicomedy that</p><p>Michael Holroyd was born in 1935 and is part Irish and half Swedish. He is the author of acclaimed biographies of Hugh Kingsmill, Lytton Strachey, and Augustus John. (The film Carrington, directed by Christopher Hampton, was based on his Lytton Strachey, and a film based on Augustus John is in preparation.) His four-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; volume biography of Shaw was originally published between 1988 and 1992, after fifteen years of research and writing. Holroyd was awarded the CBE in 1989. He lives in London and Somerset and is married to the writer Margaret Drabble.Triumphant closing of Holroyd's massive life of George Bernard Shaw (1856-1951), begun with The Search for Love (1988) and The Pursuit of Power (1989)--a work 15 years in the writing. (The notes will be published separately.) Now WW I ends and Shaw, in a Chekhovian mood, writes Heartbreak House, his elegy for prewar England, a ``tragic'' play that he slyly complains has been accepted as ``a bedroom farce.'' Shaw girds himself for his greatest labor, the five-play metabiological history and future of mankind fantasy cycle, Back to Methuselah, an unplayably long philosophical treatise (well appraised by Holroyd) that nonetheless is staged first in Manhattan, then in Birmingham (England), much to Shaw's amaze. Then he refashions into English Jitto's Atonement, a play by his German translator, although Shaw's German is far, far worse than his translator's groping, misspelled English--and it's a hit! But the press is down on him for not being serious, so he accepts his wife Charlotte's urgings and decides to rescue the real Jeanne d'Arc from the cheesy image she's fallen into and once more allow her to be a legitimate heretic in his straightforward Saint Joan--for which he is universally praised for not being Shaw--and wins the Nobel Prize. Through all these events (which include helping T.E. Lawrence correct a six-pound manuscript of Seven Pillars of Wisdom), Shaw's letters and public wit glow with no dimming of luster, although the truth is that he's a deeply shy man who likes to be alone. Mentally, his last years are strikingly vigorous despite ``the lure of fantasy'' in his playwriting. Don't miss Shaw's joy during Charlotte's last days as she undergoes remission of neurotic anxieties and drops 40 years from her face. Holroyd keeps a lightly even voice throughout so that every word Shaw utters--and he is clearly the greatest wit in the English language--glistens with intelligence against his fading hopes for humanity.

Tommy Tittlebottom sees Mr Peabody taking an apple from Mr Funkadeli&#39;s fruit market and is very surprised that he doesn&#39;t pay. Then Tommy sees it happen again and decides that Mr Peabody is a thief. Word spreads quickly around the town. When Mr Peabody arrives at the baseball ground, ready for the usual Saturday game, only Billy Little turns up and he soon explains what has happened. It is then up to Mr Peabody to teach Tommy about the importance of truth and the power of words.</p><p>With <i>Mr. Peabody's Apples</i>, her gorgeous sophomore venture into the realm of children's literature, Madonna sustains her transformation from material girl to mom. Inspired by a 300-year-old Ukrainian story and illustrated by the talented Loren Long, Madonna's tale is about the dangers of gossip. As a frequent target of the rumor mill, who better to teach the young ones about the "power of words" and their potential to cause "harm to others" than the newly reformed diva?<p> Set in a tiny American town, Madonna's story features the big-hearted and much beloved Mr. Peabody, an elementary school teacher and Little League coach who dedicates his summer Saturdays to the local losing team. The kindly teacher seems to savor life the way he savors his weekly apple--taking pleasure in the little things. One weekend after the game, Tommy Tittlebottom watches Mr. Peabody take his apple without paying for it. The following weekend Tommy calls in reinforcements to witness Mr. Peabody's transgression. By the next Saturday, Mr. Peabody's apparent theft has become grist for the Happville rumor mill and no one comes to Little League practice. These moments truly highlight Long's talents as an illustrator--the handsome Mr. Peabody (part Harry Connick Jr., part Robert Redford) comes to life on the page, his disappointment as palpable as that of Billy Little, the young boy who idolizes him. A simple explanation puts the rumors to rest, but as Mr. Peabody points out in a poignant demonstration, small talk can often lead to big trouble for everyone.</p><p> In a wonderful departure from her debut children's book <i>The English Roses</i>, Madonna has created a tribute to 1940's small-town America that delivers a fundamental message about respecting others. Children will love Mr. Peabody and parents will appreciate the gentle nudge with which he delivers his message. <i>Mr. Peabody's Apples</i> unfolds slowly, but readers young and old will want to linger over each illustrated page lovingly rendered in a muted pallet of rich color. <i>--Daphne Durham</i></p>Madonna is an international celebrity - pop star, film star and mother. She has recorded 16 albums and appeared in 18 films and is now making a very exciting move into children&#39;s books. She is married to the film producer, Guy Ritchie, and has two children. She spends her time between London and Los Angeles.</p><h2>Under Orders (Sid Halley)</h2><p>When three corpses turn up on Cheltenham Gold Cup Day, including a jockey who had earlier in the day won the Triumph Hurdle, ex-jockey-turned-sleuth Sid Halley investigates a possible link to Lord Enstone&#39;s mysterious losing streak, a probe that drags him ever deeper into the dark underside of the racing game. 350,000 first printing.</p><p>Dick Francis is the author of more than forty books, including the volume of short stories <i>Field of 13</i>, most recently, the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Shattered</i>, and his autobiography, <i>The Sport of Queens</i>. A three-time Edgar Award winner, he has also received the prestigious Crime Writers' Association's Cartier Diamond Dagger for his outstanding contribution to the genre. He was named Grand Master by the Mystery Writers of America in 1996, and was awarded the CBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours List in 2000. He divides his time between England and an island in the Caribbean.Dick Francis reacquaints listeners with champion-jockey-turned-sleuth Sid Halley, featured in earlier mysteries of the British racing circuit. The Cheltenham Gold Cup Race has more excitement than usual when a jockey is murdered. As Sid begins his sleuthing, one notices a change in tempo from the usual style of this author. Much of the change is due to the bravura reading of Martin Jarvis, who carves out the characters and gives each of them a special voice and an expansively operatic mood to surround the moment. His performance and timing are specifically aimed at the listener's entertainment as he reads the words of an older, gentler Dick Francis, whose Sid Halley is still just 38.

At his death in 1955, DeVoto had won both the Pulitzer and Bancroft prizes. But he was most famous for his eloquent writing that advocated conservation of America&#39;s prairies, rangeland, forests, mountains, canyons, and deserts.DeVoto&#39;s West: Essays on History, Conservation, and the Public Good showcases the complexity, depth, and breadth of DeVoto&#39;s thinking. Editor Edward K. Muller introduces these twenty-two essays (many of which originally appeared in Harper?s renowned column The Easy Chair) that passionately and coherently advocate federal control for vast tracts of public land. DeVoto addressed many issues, including the plundering of resources by absentee eastern corporations, Westerners? conflicted relationship to exploitation, and the degradation of the national parks. He believed that conservation of natural resources in the West required government control of public lands against livestock associations, timber interests, and their congressional allies who plotted the privatization of the national forests and the extraction of resources in the national parks. DeVoto&#39;s West collects the best of DeVoto&#39;s conservation pieces for the first time. It will introduce a new generation to prose that has retained its relevance and remains a remarkably current and timely argument for protecting public lands.Bernard DeVoto was born in Ogden, Utah, in 1897. He spent his adult life in the East, first teaching English at Northwestern University, Chicago, then living in New York, and finally settling in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He is the subject of an acclaimed biography, The Uneasy Chair, by Wallace Stegner.Edward K. Muller is a professor of history and director of the Urban Studies Program at the University of Pittsburgh.

It features over 6,000 of the most commonly used single-characters and over 12,000 terms to illustrate the use of the characters.</p></p><p>Focus East is an examination of the intent, scope, and purpose of photography in the Middle East in the mid-19th century. It discusses why photographs were taken, who wanted them, and what purposes they served. There is a very valuable listing and short biography of the photographers represented and such instructive chapters as "Orientalism and Art." Though most of the photographs are fascinating, no real theme binds them together, making it difficult to determine for whom the book was intended. Graham-Brown has provided us with a social history showing how photography both obscured and illuminated the real status of women in the Middle East. The photographs are of Jews and Arabs over almost a century in every conceivable role. The text, carefully researched and well written, discusses the relationship between Oriental and Western society, the impact of photography on the Middle East, and the changing outlook on the role of women. The quality of the photographs in this scholarly study is excellent. Both volumes provide us with a visual image of the Middle East in the 19th century, although Graham-Brown takes us to the mid-20th century and permits us to see the changes that have occurred.

The volume begins with an autobiographical sketch and culminates in a conversation with Jean Grondin that looks back over a lifetime of productive philosophical work. The essays not already available in English have here been translated by Richard E. Palmer, a respected translator of Gadamer's writings. The sixteen essays contained in the Lesebuch are augmented here by three other essays: Gadamer's last essay on Derrida, "Hermeneutics Tracking the Trace" (1994) and two essays on practical philosophy. <i>The Gadamer Reader: A Bouquet of the Later Writings</i> richly conveys the scope and depth of Gadamer's thought, covering the range of his work in hermeneutics, aesthetics, practical philosophy, and essays on Plato, Hegel, and Heidegger. In addition, Palmer offers introductory remarks before each essay that explain its importance in the context of Gadamer's writings and define its key terms. Throughout, in both his translation and commentary, his aim is to make this critically important philosopher as clear and accessible as possible to an English-speaking audience.<br></p><p>Richard E.

With poems in the leading journals of the day -- American Poetry Review, Grand Street, Conjunctions, The Boston Review, to name just a few -- Gander plumbs the erotic depths of human interaction with the land. The poems in Science &amp; Steepleflower test this relationship with what Publisher's Weekly has called "an inbred (and often haunting) spirituality", bringing us to new vistas of linguistic and perceptive grace.</p><p>There's a lustrous assurance to Forrest Gander's poems, as if each one were a solution to a problem the poet had worked out before he wrote a word. With his third book, <i>Science &amp; Steepleflower</i>, Gander also proves that he is among the most gifted and accomplished poets of his generation. The collection is remarkable for its mixture of forms and sheer immediacy. And the titles alone are proof of the author's philosophical ambition--there's "Duration and Simultaneity," "The History of Manifest Destiny," and "Deflection Toward the Relative Minor": <blockquote> But the clarity<br> of the word "is"<br> is a deception.<br> </blockquote> Often Gander uses the equivalent of a wide-angle lens to examine the connection between the subject and its context. "Exhaustible Appearance," written in response to a photograph, begins: "Around the burning barn, stationary objects seem to stream. / Scrub brush, twigs in sinople dirt, dry weeds, / puffballs among scattered breccia and chert." Yes, the vocabulary is rather recondite. But as R.P. Blackmur pointed out in a famous essay on Wallace Stevens, a phrase like "the moonlight fubbed the girandoles" is perfectly comprehensible if you have a dictionary at hand. And in Gander's case, his esoteric lexicon draws attention not only to itself but to the hardscrabble landscape it describes. This is reality, he seems to be saying--even if you have to look it up. <i>--Mark Rudman</i>Forrest Gander was born in the Mojave Desert and grew up in Virginia. In addition to writing poetry, he has translated works by Coral Bracho, Alfonso D&#x2019;Aquino, Pura Lopez-Colome, Pablo Neruda, and Jaime Saenz.

Between them they have five children, six grandchildren, and three Labradors.<b>Chapter 1</b><p>In a broad valley, at the foot of a sloping hillside, beside a clear bubbling stream, Tom was building a house. </p><p>The walls were already three feet high and rising fast. The two masons Tom had engaged were working steadily in the sunshine, their trowels going <i>scrape, slap</i> and then <i>tap, tap</i> while their laborer sweated under the weight of the big stone blocks. Tom&#x2019;s son Alfred was mixing mortar, counting aloud as he scooped sand onto a board. There was also a carpenter, working at the bench beside Tom, carefully shaping a length of beech wood with an adz. </p><p>Alfred was fourteen years old, and tall like Tom. Tom was a head higher than most men, and Alfred was only a couple of inches less, and still growing. They looked alike too: both had light-brown hair and greenish eyes with brown flecks. People said they were a handsome pair. The main difference between them was that Tom had a curly brown beard, whereas Alfred had only a fine blond fluff. The hair on Alfred&#x2019;s head had been that color once, Tom remembered fondly. Now that Alfred was becoming a man, Tom wished he would take a more intelligent interest in his work, for he had a lot to learn if he was to be a mason like his father; but so far Alfred remained bored and baffled by the principles of building. </p><p>When the house was finished it would be the most luxurious home for miles around. The ground floor would be a spacious undercroft, for storage, with a curved vault for a ceiling, so that it would not catch fire. The hall, where people actually lived, would be above, reached by an outside staircase, its height making it hard to attack and easy to defend. Against the hall wall there would be a chimney, to take away the smoke of the fire. This was a radical innovation: Tom had only ever seen one house with a chimney, but it had struck him as such a good idea that he was determined to copy it. At one end of the house, over the hall, there would be a small bedroom, for that was what earls&#x2019; daughters demanded nowadays&#x2014;they were too fine to sleep in the hall with the men and the serving wenches and the hunting dogs. The kitchen would be a separate building, for every kitchen caught fire sooner or later, and there was nothing for it but to build them far away from everything else and put up with lukewarm food. </p><p>Tom was making the doorway of the house. The doorposts would be rounded to look like columns&#x2014;a touch of distinction for the noble newlyweds who were to live here. With his eye on the shaped wooden template he was using as a guide, Tom set his iron chisel obliquely against the stone and tapped it gently with the big wooden hammer. A small shower of fragments fell away from the surface, leaving the shape a little rounder. He did it again. Smooth enough for a cathedral. </p><p>He had worked on a cathedral once&#x2014;Exeter. At first he had treated it like any other job. He had been angry and resentful when the master builder had warned him that his work was not quite up to standard: he knew himself to be rather more careful than the average mason. But then he realized that the walls of a cathedral had to be not just good, but <i>perfect</i>. This was because the cathedral was for God, and also because the building was so <i>big</i> that the slightest lean in the walls, the merest variation from the absolutely true and level, could weaken the structure fatally. Tom&#x2019;s resentment turned to fascination. The combination of a hugely ambitious building with merciless attention to the smallest detail opened Tom&#x2019;s eyes to the wonder of his craft. He learned from the Exeter master about the importance of proportion, the symbolism of various numbers, and the almost magical formulas for working out the correct width of a wall or the angle of a step in a spiral staircase. Such things captivated him. He was surprised to learn that many masons found them incomprehensible. </p><p>After a while Tom had become the master builder&#x2019;s right-hand man, and that was when he began to see the master&#x2019;s shortcomings. The man was a great craftsman and an incompetent organizer. He was completely baffled by the problems of obtaining the right quantity of stone to keep pace with the masons, making sure that the blacksmith made enough of the right tools, burning lime and carting sand for the mortar makers, felling trees for the carpenters, and getting enough money from the cathedral chapter to pay for everything. </p><p>If Tom had stayed at Exeter until the master builder died, he might have become master himself; but the chapter ran out of money&#x2014;partly because of the master&#x2019;s mismanagement&#x2014;and the craftsmen had to move on, looking for work elsewhere. Tom had been offered the post of builder to the Exeter castellan, repairing and improving the city&#x2019;s fortifications. It would have been a lifetime job, barring accidents. But Tom had turned it down, for he wanted to build another cathedral. </p><p>His wife, Agnes, had never understood that decision. They might have had a good stone house, and servants, and their own stables, and meat on the table every dinnertime; and she had never forgiven Tom for turning down the opportunity. She could not comprehend the irresistible attraction of building a cathedral: the absorbing complexity of organization, the intellectual challenge of the calculations, the sheer size of the walls, and the breathtaking beauty and grandeur of the finished building. Once he had tasted that wine, Tom was never satisfied with anything less. </p><p>That had been ten years ago. Since then they had never stayed anywhere for very long. He would design a new chapter house for a monastery, work for a year or two on a castle, or build a town house for a rich merchant; but as soon as he had some money saved he would leave, with his wife and children, and take to the road, looking for another cathedral. </p><p>He glanced up from his bench and saw Agnes standing at the edge of the building site, holding a basket of food in one hand and resting a big jug of beer on the opposite hip. It was midday. He looked at her fondly. No one would ever call her pretty, but her face was full of strength: a broad forehead, large brown eyes, a straight nose, a strong jaw. Her dark, wiry hair was parted in the middle and tied behind. She was Tom&#x2019;s soul mate. </p><p>She poured beer for Tom and Alfred. They stood there for a moment, the two big men and the strong woman, drinking beer from wooden cups; and then the fourth member of the family came skipping out of the wheat field: Martha, seven years old and as pretty as a daffodil, but a daffodil with a petal missing, for she had a gap where two milk teeth had fallen out and the new ones had not yet grown. She ran to Tom, kissed his dusty beard, and begged a sip of his bear. He hugged her bony body. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t drink too much, or you&#x2019;ll fall into a ditch,&#x201d; he said. She staggered around in a circle, pretending to be drunk. </p><p>They all sat down on the woodpile. Agnes handed Tom a hunk of wheat bread, a thick slice of boiled bacon and a small onion. He took a bite from the meat and started to peel the onion. Agnes gave the children food and began to eat her own. Perhaps it was irresponsible, Tom thought, to turn down that dull job in Exeter and go looking for a cathedral to build; but I&#x2019;ve always been able to feed them all, despite my recklessness. </p><p>He took his eating knife from the front pocket of his leather apron, cut a slice off the onion, and ate it with a bite of bread. The onion was sweet and stinging in his mouth. Agnes said: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m with child again.&#x201d; </p><p>Tom stopped chewing and stared at her. A thrill of delight took hold of him. Not knowing what to say, he just smiled foolishly at her. After a few moments she blushed, and said, &#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t <i>that</i> surprising.&#x201d; </p><p>Tom hugged her. &#x201c;Well, well,&#x201d; he said, still grinning with pleasure. &#x201c;A babe to pull my beard. And I thought the next would be Alfred&#x2019;s.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t get too happy yet,&#x201d; Agnes cautioned. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s bad luck to name the child before it&#x2019;s born.&#x201d; </p><p>Tom nodded assent. Agnes had had several miscarriages and one stillborn baby, and there had been another little girl, Matilda, who had lived on two years. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like a boy, though,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Now that Alfred&#x2019;s so big. When is it due?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;After Christmas.&#x201d; </p><p>Tom began to calculate. The shell of the house would be finished by first frost, then the stonework would have to be covered with straw to protect it through the winter. The masons would spend the cold months cutting stones for windows, vaults, doorcases and the fireplace, while the carpenter made floorboards and doors and shutters and Tom built the scaffolding for the upstairs work. Then in spring they would vault the undercroft, floor the hall above it, and put on the roof. The job would feed the family until Whitsun, by which time the baby would be a half year old. Then they would move on. &#x201c;Good,&#x201d; he said contentedly. &#x201c;This is good.&#x201d; He ate another slice of onion. </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m too old to bare children,&#x201d; said Agnes. &#x201c;This must be my last.&#x201d; </p><p>Tom thought about that. He was not sure how old she was, in numbers, but plenty of women bore children at her time in life. However, it was true they suffered more as they grew older, and the babies were not as strong. No doubt she was right. But how would she make certain that she would not conceive again? he wondered. Then he realized how, and a cloud shadowed his sunny mood. </p><p>&#x201c;I may get a good job, in a town,&#x201d; he said, trying to mollify her. &#x201c;A cathedral, or a palace. Then we might have a big house with wood floors, and a maid to help you with the baby.&#x201d; </p><p>Her face hardened, and she said skeptically: &#x201c;It may be.&#x201d; She did not like to hear talk of cathedrals. If Tom had never worked on a cathedral, her face said, she might be living in a town house now, with money saved up and buried under the fireplace, and nothing to worry about. </p><p>Tom looked away and took another bite of bacon. They had something to celebrate, but they were in disharmony. He felt let down. He chewed the tough meat for a while, then he heard a horse. He cocked his head to listen. The rider was coming through the trees from the direction of the road, taking a short cut and avoiding the village. </p><p>A moment later, a young man on a pony trotted up and dismounted. He looked like a squire, a kind of apprentice knight. &#x201c;Your lord is coming,&#x201d; he said. </p><p>Tom stood up. &#x201c;You mean Lord Percy?&#x201d; Percy Hamleigh was one of the most important men in the country. He owned this valley, and many others, and he was paying for the house. </p><p>&#x201c;His son,&#x201d; said the squire. </p><p>&#x201c;Young William.&#x201d; Percy&#x2019;s son, William, was to occupy this house after his marriage. He was engaged to Lady Aliena, the daughter of the earl of Shiring. </p><p>&#x201c;The same,&#x201d; said the squire, &#x201c;And in a rage.&#x201d; </p><p>Tom&#x2019;s heart sank. At the best of times it could be difficult to deal with the owner of a house under construction. An owner in a rage was impossible. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s he angry about?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;His bride rejected him.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;The earl&#x2019;s daughter?&#x201d; said Tom in surprise. He felt a pang of fear: he had just been thinking how secure his future was. &#x201c;I thought that was settled.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;So did we all&#x2014;except Lady Aliena, it seems,&#x201d; the squire said. &#x201c;The moment she met him, she announced that she wouldn&#x2019;t marry him for all the world and a woodcock.&#x201d; </p><p>Tom frowned worriedly. He did not want this to be true. &#x201c;But the boy&#x2019;s not bad-looking, as I recall.&#x201d; </p><p>Agnes said: &#x201c;As if that made any difference, in her position. If earls&#x2019; daughters were allowed to marry whom they please, we&#x2019;d all be ruled by strolling minstrels and dark-eyed outlaws.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;The girl may yet change her mind,&#x201d; Tom said hopefully. </p><p>&#x201c;She will if her mother takes a birch rod to her,&#x201d; Agnes said. </p><p>The squire said: &#x201c;Her mother&#x2019;s dead.&#x201d; </p><p>Agnes nodded. &#x201c;That explains why she doesn&#x2019;t know the facts of life. But I don&#x2019;t see why her father can&#x2019;t compel her.&#x201d; </p><p>The squire said: &#x201c;It seems he once promised he would never marry her to someone she hated.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;A foolish pledge!&#x201d; Tom said angrily. How could a powerful man tie himself to the whim of a girl in that way? Her marriage could affect military alliances, baronial finances... even the building of this house. </p><p>The squire said: &#x201c;She had a brother, so it&#x2019;s not <i>so</i> important whom she marries.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Even so...&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And the earl is an unbending man,&#x201d; the squire went on. &#x201c;He won&#x2019;t go back on a promise, even one made to a child.&#x201d; He shrugged. &#x201c;So they say.&#x201d; </p><p>Tom looked at the low stone walls of the house-to-be. He had not yet saved enough money to keep the family through winter, he realized with a chill. &#x201c;Perhaps the lad will find another bride to share this place with him. He&#x2019;s got the whole county to choose from.&#x201d; </p><p>Alfred spoke in a cracked adolescent voice. &#x201c;By Christ, I think this is him.&#x201d; Following his gaze, they all looked across the field. A horse was coming from the village in a gallop, kicking up a cloud of dust and earth from the pathway. Alfred&#x2019;s oath was prompted by the size as well as the speed of the horse: it was huge. Tom had seen beasts like it before, but perhaps Alfred had not. It was a war-horse, as high at the wither as a man&#x2019;s chin, and broad in proportion. Such war-horses were not bred in England, but came from overseas, and were enormously costly. </p><p>Tom dropped the remains of his bread in the pocket of his apron, then narrowed his eyes against the sun and gazed across the field. The horse had its ears back and nostrils flared, but it seemed to Tom that its head was up, a sign that it was not completely out of control. Sure enough, as it came closer the rider leaned back, hauling on the reins, and the huge animal seemed to slow a little. Now Tom could feel the drumming of its hooves in the ground beneath his feet. He looked around for Martha, thinking to pick her up and put her out of harm&#x2019;s way. Agnes had the same thought. But Martha was not to be seen. </p><p>&#x201c;In the wheat,&#x201d; Agnes said, but Tom had already figured that out and was striding across the site to the edge of the field. He scanned the waving wheat with fear in his heart but he could not see the child. </p><p>The only thing he could think of was to try and slow the horse. He stepped into the path and began to walk toward the charging beast, holding his arms wide. The horse saw him, raised its head for a better look, and slowed perceptibly. Then, to Tom&#x2019;s horror, the rider spurred it on. </p><p>&#x201c;You damned fool!&#x201d; Tom roared, although the rider could not hear. </p><p>That was when Martha stepped out of the field and into the pathway a few yards in front of Tom. </p><p>For an instant Tom stood still in a sick panic. Then he leaped forward, shouting and waving his arms; but this was a war-horse, trained to charge at yelling hordes, and it did not flinch. Martha stood in the middle of the narrow path, staring as if transfixed by the huge beast bearing down on her. There was a moment when Tom realized desperately that he could not get to her before the horse did. He swerved to one side, his arm touching the standing wheat; and at the last instant the horse swerved to the other side. The rise&#x2019;s stirrup brushed Martha&#x2019;s fine hair; a hoof stamped a hole in the ground beside her bare foot; then the horse had gone by, spraying them both with dirt, and Tom snatched her up in his arms and held her tight to his pou...</p></p><h2>Blenheim (Great battles)</h2><p>Great book from the Arco Great battles Series about the battle of Blenheim</p><p></p><h2>Love Times Three: Our True Story of a Polygamous Marriage</h2><p>From&nbsp;a&nbsp;familythat inspired <em>Big Love</em>&#x2019;s story of Bill Henricksonand his three wives, this first-ever memoir of a polygamous family captures theextraordinary workings of a unique family dynamic, and&nbsp;argues&nbsp;forthe acceptance of plural marriage&nbsp;as an alternative lifestyle.

She drives a minivan, and she&#x2019;d be lost without her trusty BlackBerry. They go on date nights. Their kids attend public schools, play sports, and take music lessons. They live in a roomy house in the &#x2019;burbs. They&#x2019;re about as mainstream as families come....They&#x2019;re also polygamists.</p><p>For decades, polygamous families have been forced to hide their lifestyle. Men risk prosecution and economic blacklisting, and women face social isolation and faulty assumptions about what it means to live as a sister wife. But <em>Love Times Three</em>, the first-ever memoir of a polygamous family, is a riveting inside look at a world most of us can hardly imagine, revealing the extraordinary workings of the Dargers&#x2019; day-to-day life. </p><p>Independent Fundamentalist Mormons, the Dargers grew up in polygamous families, and by the time they were in high school, they knew they wanted to live the Principle themselves. But in a highly unusual situation, even for their culture, both Alina and Vicki expressed interest in Joe at the same time. They ultimately courted him together, and married him on the same day. Valerie, Vicki&#x2019;s twin sister, joined the marriage ten years later. </p><p>The Dargers move the conversation away from child brides, Warren Jeffs, and the FLDS to more mainstream polygamists who willingly enter into plural relationships as adults. Rather than living in isolated communities, Independent Fundamentalist Mormons are similar to an average American family&#x2014;except for their family structure. </p><p>In this intimate, inside story, the Dargers explain why they chose this path despite the pressures of keeping their relationships secret and the jealousy and personal challenges that naturally ensue, why they believe polygamy should be an accepted lifestyle, and, ultimately, why they hope that by revealing their way of life in public, laws that criminalize their lifestyle might change.</p><p>Written in the voices of the four parents, <em>Love Times Three</em> is the story of one man, his three wives, and their twenty-four children as they live out their faith in a world of prejudice, misconception, and fear, including a chapter on the sister wife dynamic, one from Joe on how he juggles his three distinct romantic relationships, and a chapter from three of their children, called &#x201c;My Three Moms.&#x201d; Despite the risk of legal action, the Dargers know that it&#x2019;s time to counteract Hollywood&#x2019;s sensational interpretation and correct the general public&#x2019;s misunderstanding of polygamy with the truth.

Now reissued in a new cover style. &#39;Floating Dragon racks you with suspense! Straub is a master at having whole communities rocked by the forces of wickedness.&#39; Observer The terrors afflicting the sleepy town of Hampstead, Connecticut, were beyond imagination. Sparrows dropping dead from the trees like rotten fruit, disfiguring diseases spreading like wildfire, inexplicable murders and child drownings shattering the lives of the citizens -- never can such a list of horrors have afflicted one town. But the evil madness had a long history. A catastrophe had struck Hampstead every thirty years since its foundation 300 years before -- yet only Graham Williams, a writer and descendant of one of the original founders, had looked into the &#39;black summers&#39; and their mysterious origins. When he discovers that descendants of the three other original settlers are back living in the town, he knows it will be the blackest summer yet!</p><p><p>Peter Straub is one of America&#x2019;s foremost authors of supernatural and suspense fiction.

Not only adventures, they were the salvation of her marriage. In college she had juggled four boyfriends, and only one of them, a mathematics graduate student named Leo Friedgood, had known of the existence of the others. Leo had seemed amused by her secretiveness, as he was amused by her private school nickname. Only after several months did Stony realize the extent to which amusement masked arousal.</p><p>She married him just after graduation&#x2014;no graduate school for Stony, and no more for Leo, who shaved his beard and bought a suit and took a job with Telpro Corporation, which had an office in Santa Monica.</p><p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><i><b>1969</b></i></p><p>Tabby Smithfield grew to the age of five in an enormous stone house in Hampstead, Connecticut, with four acres of well-tended ground and a burglar alarm on the front gates. The neighborhood, consisting of sixteen houses along Long Island Sound, was impressive enough to attract its own tourists; perhaps six cars a day trolled down Mount Avenue, the drivers and passengers leaning to glimpse the mansions behind the gates. Locally, Mount Avenue was &#x201c;The Golden Mile,&#x201d; though it was twice longer than that; it was the original road between Hillhaven, the Victorian suburb of Patchin, and Hampstead. Mount Avenue, the site of the original farm settlements of Hampstead and Hillhaven, had once been the principal coaching road north to New Haven, but its hectic days were long past. Manufacturers with plants in Bridgeport or Woodville, a doctor, and the head of Patchin County&#x2019;s biggest legal practice lived in the impressive houses, along with others like them, older people who wished no excitement in their private lives. Tourists rubbernecking along the Golden Mile rarely saw them&#x2014;there might be a visiting movie star taking the sea-laden air along the coastal road or a college president pausing for breath before he made his pitch for funds, but the owners of the houses were invisible.</p><p>Outside the gray stone house, however, those taking a fast peek through the opened gates in 1969 might have seen a tall dark-haired man in tennis whites playing with a small boy. Perhaps a uniformed nanny would have been hovering on the steps before the front door, her posture inexplicably tense. And perhaps the boy&#x2019;s posture too would have seemed awkward, inhabited by the same tension, as if little Tabby Smithfield were half-aware that he was not supposed to be playing with his father. They make an oddly static and incomplete scene, father and son and nanny. They are badly composed: one figure is missing.</p><p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><i><b>1964</b></i></p><p>Stony Friedgood&#x2019;s first affair after her marriage was in 1964, with the husband of a friend, a neighbor in their neat row of tract houses: he was unlike Leo, being jovial and blond and easygoing, a very junior banker, and Leo invariably spoke of him with contempt. This affair endured only two months.</p><p>Stony&#x2019;s delicate face, which was sharp-featured and framed in shining brown hair, became familiar in galleries and art museums, in certain bars at certain times. Considered from a utilitarian point of view, one neither Stony&#x2019;s nor Leo&#x2019;s parents could have understood, the Friedgoods had a successful marriage. By the time Leo was promoted twice and transferred to Telpro&#x2019;s New York offices, their income had doubled and Stony weighed only a pound more than when she was a student at Scripps. She left behind her yoga classes, a half-completed gourmet-cooking course, four unused tickets to a concert series, the undigested and already vague memories of six or seven men. Leo left nothing at all behind&#x2014;the company paid to ship east his sailboat and the eight cases he called his &#x201c;cellar.&#x201d;</p><p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><i><b>1968</b></i></p><p>Monty Smithfield, his grandfather, was the great figure in Tabby&#x2019;s early childhood. It was Monty who kissed him first when he returned from nursery school, and Monty and his mother took him to his first haircut. Birthdays and Christmases Monty gave him stupefying presents, vast train sets and every possible sort of preschool vehicle from walkers to Big Wheels, even a dwarf pony stabled at a riding school. This was presented with much fanfare at Tabby&#x2019;s third birthday. August, 1968. Monty had provided a party for twenty children, a band playing Beatle songs and tunes from Disney movies, an ice sculpture of a brontosaurus&#x2014;Tabby loved dinosaurs then, and only evolution kept Monty Smithfield from buying his grandson a baby monster. &#x201c;Come on, Clark,&#x201d; called the jubilant old man as the gardener led out the shaggy little pony. &#x201c;Mount your son on this great beast.&#x201d; But Clark Smithfield had gone inside to his bedroom and was at that moment whacking a tennis ball against the elaborate headboard with a well-worn Spaulding racket, trying to chip the paint off one of the wooden curlicues.</p><p>Like any child, Tabby had no idea of what his father did for a living, no idea that there was a living to be earned. Clark Smithfield was at home four or five days every week, playing his rock records in the living room of their wing of the big house, going out to tennis matches whenever he could. If at the age of three or four Tabby had been asked what his father did, he would have answered that he played games. Clark never took him to the company of which he was a nominal vice-president; his grandfather did, and showed him off to the secretaries, announcing that here was the future chairman of the board of Smithfield Systems, Inc. Before he showed Tabby the computer room, the old man opened a door and said, &#x201c;For the record, this is your father&#x2019;s office.&#x201d; It was a small dusty room containing an almost bare desk and many photographs of Tabby&#x2019;s father winning college tennis tournaments; also a Richard Nixon dart board, as dusty as everything else. &#x201c;Does my daddy work here?&#x201d; Tabby asked with sweet innocence, and one of the secretaries snickered. &#x201c;He <i>does</i>,&#x201d; Tabby insisted valiantly. &#x201c;He <i>does</i> work here. Look! He plays tennis here!&#x201d; A spasm of distaste passed over Monty Smithfield&#x2019;s tidy features, and the old man did not smile for the remainder of the tour.</p><p>Whenever his father and grandfather were in the same room&#x2014;at the family dinners Clark could not avoid, at any occasion when Monty came into his son&#x2019;s living quarters&#x2014;an almost visible atmosphere of dislike frosted the air. At these times Tabby saw his father shrink to a child only slightly older than himself. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you like Grandpa?&#x201d; he asked his father once, when Clark was reading him a bedtime story. &#x201c;Oh, it&#x2019;s too complicated for you,&#x201d; Clark sighed.</p><p>At times, more frequently as he grew closer to five, Tabby heard them fighting.</p><p>Clark and his father argued about the length of Clark&#x2019;s hair, about Clark&#x2019;s aspirations as a tennis player (which his father scorned), about Clark&#x2019;s attitude. Clark and Monty Smithfield normally kept a cool distance from each other, but when Monty decided to harangue his son, they shouted&#x2014;in the dining room, in both living rooms, in the hallway, on the lawn. These arguments always ended with Clark storming away from his father.</p><p>&#x201c;What are you going to do?&#x201d; Monty called out to him after a wrangle Tabby witnessed. &#x201c;Leave home? You can&#x2019;t <i>afford</i> to&#x2014;you couldn&#x2019;t <i>get</i> another job.&#x201d;</p><p>Tabby&#x2019;s face went white&#x2014;he didn&#x2019;t understand the words, but he heard the scorn in them. That day he did not speak until dinnertime.</p><p>Clark&#x2019;s wife and mother were the glue that held the two families in their uneasy harmony: Monty genuinely liked Jean, Tabby&#x2019;s mother, and Jean and her mother-in-law kept Clark in his job. Maybe if Clark Smithfield had been either a twenty-percent-better tennis player than he was, or a twenty-percent-worse one, the misery in the old house on Mount Avenue would have dissipated. Or if he had been less intransigent, his father less adamant. But Jean and her mother-in-law, thinking that the passage of time would reconcile Clark to his job and Monty to his son, kept the families together. And so they stayed, in their sometimes almost comfortable antagonism. Until the first truly terrible thing that happened to Tabby and his family.</p><p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><i><b>1975</b></i></p><p>The Friedgoods, who appeared to be a model couple, moved to a builder&#x2019;s colonial in Hampstead in 1975, when Tabby Smithfield was ten years old and living with his father and stepmother in South Florida. As Leo Friedgood was on his way upward into the world he coveted, Clark Smithfield appeared to be running out his meager luck: he had a job as a bartender, quit that to take a job as salesman for Hollinsworth Vitreous, was fired from that when he got drunk on the yacht belonging to the president of the company and vomited on Robert Hollinsworth&#x2019;s carpet-weave slippers, did another stint tending bar, and took a job as a security guard. He worked nights and nipped from a bottle whenever his round took him back to the security station. Like his first wife, his mother was also dead&#x2014;Agnes Smithfield had suffered a cerebral hemorrhage one warm May morning as she discussed the installation of a rock garden with the groundsman and her life had fled before her body struck the ground. Monty Smithfield had sold his big house on Mount Avenue and moved with the housekeeper and cook into a house called &#x201c;Four Hearths&#x201d; on Hermitage Road, five minutes inland. His end of Hermitage Road was only two wooded hilly blocks from the place the Friedgoods bought.</p><p>Leo was now a division vice-president for Telpro, making nearly fifty thousand dollars a year; he bought his suits at Tripler, grew a thick aggressive mustache and let his hair get long enough to be bushy. Always fleshy, he had put on twenty extra pounds despite a daily mile-long jog, and now&#x2014;arrogant eyes, dark mustache and unrestrained hair&#x2014;he had the faintly lawless, buccaneerlike appearance of many a corporate executive who sees himself as a predator in a jungle full of predators.</p><p>In 1975, the first year on Cannon Road in Hampstead, Stony joined New Neighbors, High Minds&#x2014;a book discussion group&#x2014;the League of Women Voters and a cooking class, the YMCA, and the library. She would have looked for a job, but Leo did not want her to work. She would have tried to get pregnant, but Leo, whose own childhood was an epic of maternal bullying, became irrational when she tried to discuss it. In the <i>Hampstead Gazette</i> she read an ad for a yoga class and quit the New Neighbors. Soon after, she left High Minds and the League too.</p><p>The <i>Hampstead Gazette</i> came twice weekly. The little tabloid was Stony&#x2019;s chief source of information about her new town. From it she learned of the Women&#x2019;s Art League, and joined that, thinking she would meet painters&#x2014;one of the boys in California had been a painter. And because she wanted to, of course she did. Pat Dobbin was celebrated locally, neither especially good nor bad; he lived alone in a small house in the woods; he did illustrations&#x2014;these much better than his paintings&#x2014;to make a living. During one of Leo&#x2019;s business trips, she attended an Art League dinner with the painter: she was aware that the midge-sized red-haired woman carrying a notebook was Sarah Spry, author of the weekly social column &#x201c;What Sarah Saw&#x201d; in the <i>Gazette</i>, but was not prepared to see this item in the next week&#x2019;s column:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Sarah Saw:</i> Thistown&#x2019;s brilliant painter and illustrator PAT DOBBIN (can&#x2019;t say enough about the boy! Caught his stunning new abstract seascapes at PALMER GALLERY yet?) at the Women&#x2019;s Art League bash parading in elegant black tie and showing off a lovely mystery woman. Who&#x2019;s the unknown beauty, Pat? Fess up and tell Sarah.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When Leo returned from his trip, he read this paragraph and asked, &#x201c;Did you enjoy the Art League thing Friday night? Too bad I couldn&#x2019;t have gone with you.&#x201d; His eyes were bright and ironic.</p><p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><i><b>November 1970</b></i></p><p>Unlike her husband, Jean Smithfield was a careful driver. When she and Clark left their son with his grandparents for an evening, she always insisted on driving home if Clark went over his normal limit of two drinks before dinner and a couple of glasses of wine while they ate. On nights when Clark complained more than usually about his father or reminisced through ancient tennis matches, she drove home even if it meant listening to Clark railing about her relationship with his father. He would say, &#x201c;You actually <i>like</i> that old buzzard! Do you know what that does to me? Christ, sometimes I think he turns you on&#x2014;all those pinstripe suits get to you, don&#x2019;t they? You dig white hair. You don&#x2019;t have any more loyalty to me than to let the old man&#x2019;s phony charm get to you.&#x201d; If Clark were really bad, he&#x2019;d pass out before they pulled through the gates. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll never get Tabby,&#x201d; he would mutter. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll never forget I existed and make Tabby into his son. One thing he&#x2019;ll never do.&#x201d; Jean did her best to ignore this ranting.</p><p>They usually ate at a French restaurant up toward Patchin on the Post Road. One night in late November in 1970, Jean took a dollar from her bag as they went outside and stationed herself where the valet could see her. &#x201c;I can drive,&#x201d; Clark grumped. &#x201c;Not tonight,&#x201d; she said, and gave the bill to the boy when he got out of their car. &#x201c;We ought to have a goddamned Mercedes,&#x201d; Clark said as he let himself into the passenger seat. &#x201c;All it takes is money,&#x201d; she informed him.</p><p>Jean pulled out across the oncoming lane and pointed the car toward Pigeon Lane, the next traffic light.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s at it again,&#x201d; Clark muttered. &#x201c;He wants to send Tabby to the Academy&#x2014;public school isn&#x2019;t good enough for his grandson.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You went to the Academy,&#x201d; Jean said.</p><p>&#x201c;Because my father could <i>afford</i> it!&#x201d; Clark screamed. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you get the point, dammit? I&#x2019;m Tabby&#x2019;s father, dammit, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>Jean was looking at him and she saw his face go slack as the sentence died away. Clark no longer looked angry or drunk. He looked worried.</p><p>She snapped her head forward and saw a station wagon sliding across the dividing line, coming toward them. <i>Ice</i>, she thought, <i>a patch of</i>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>&#x201c;Move it!&#x201d; Clark shouted. And Jean twisted the wheel to the right. Another car which had pulled out of the restaurant just behind them struck her left-rear bumper so hard that Jean&#x2019;s hands flew off the steering wheel.</p><p>The station wagon, which had been going nearly fifty miles an hour before it struck the slick of ice, slammed straight into her door. Jean Smithfield tried to say &#x201c;Tabby&#x201d; before she died, but the door had crushed her chest and she did not have time.</p><p>In the mansion on Mount Avenue, her son woke up screaming.</p><p>The nineteen-year-old driver of the station wagon fell out of his car and tried to crawl away across the frozen road. He was bleeding from his scalp. Clark Smithfield, completely unharmed, took one look at his wife and threw up in his lap. Then he got out of the car and fell to his knees. Clark saw the boy who had killed his wife and yelled at him to stop. He struggled to his feet. The boy sat up twenty feet...</p></p><h2>The A-Z Guide to Babylon 5</h2><p>The highly rated, award-winning sci-fi hit Babylon 5 has captured the imaginations of millions of fans.

Modigliani, explains British biographer Rose (Elizabeth Fry, 1981--not reviewed), was the product of an upper-class Jewish- Italian family. After art studies in Livorno, Florence, and Venice, where he spent more time in cafes and brothels than in class, he arrived in Paris in 1906, seeking fame and fortune. Within weeks, the somber reality of poverty set in--moving from seedy hotel to seedy hotel, he wound up living in a wooden shack in Montmartre. There, and later in Montparnasse, he met many of the foremost artists, writers, and ``characters'' of the day, including Picasso, Soutine, Utrillo, Cocteau, Hans Arp, and Fernand L&#x201a;ger. Because of his success with women, Modigliani had easy access to free models (``Women of a beauty worth painting or sculpting often seem encumbered by their clothes,'' he said). Rose seems torn between downplaying what she refers to as the ``Modigliani myth'' and relating dozens of stories that have served to create that myth. Included are accounts of how Modigliani danced wildly in the moonlight with a famous courtesan; of how one of his first collectors was a senior police official who first met the painter when he was jailed for drunkenness; and of how the artist's only one-man gallery show was closed ``for indecency'' the day it opened. Rose does attempt to disentangle fact from fiction as she meticulously cites her sources for each anecdote, and she points out that it is the work that distinguishes the artist, not the antics. The day after Modigliani died from tubercular meningitis at age 35, his young wife killed herself. Prices for his paintings have skyrocketed ever since. Despite the somewhat misleading subtitle, this is not a paean to la vie de la boh&#x160;me, but a tragic story of art transcending life. (Eight color, 64 b&amp;w illustrations.) -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Rose's "romantic" biography of Italian modernist Amedeo Modigliani (1884-1920) avoids detailed art criticism while engaging the reader in a fully lucid and documented account of his life from a bourgeois childhood in Livorno, Italy to his early death in poverty and despair. In between was a Montparnasse bohemian existence with such contemporaries as Brancusi, Picasso, and Matisse. Similar treatments of the artist's life include his daughter Jenne's Modigliani: Man and Myth (1959), William Fifield's Modigliani (Morrow, 1976), and Carol Mann's Modigliani (Oxford Univ. Pr., 1980). Furthermore, a novel by Anthony Wilmot, The Last Bohemian: A Novel About Modigliani (McDonald &amp; Janes, 1975) puts the facts to fiction. Indeed, Modigliani's lifestyle has seduced the imagination of succeeding generations in a pursuit ever after of the Parisian myths of that period. This is a personal testament to those enduring myths. Illustrations, mostly black and white, are chosen for their historical significance.

Stereotypes depict Islamic societies as economically backward, hyper-patriarchal, and fanatically religious. But in fact, the Islamic world encompasses a great diversity of cultures and a great deal of variation within those cultures in terms of gender roles and sexuality.<br> The first collection on this topic from a historical and anthropological perspective, Homosexuality in the Muslim World reveals that patterns of male and female homosexuality have existed and often flourished within the Islamic world. Indeed, same-sex relations have, until quite recently, been much more tolerated under Islam than in the Christian West. Based on the latest theoretical perspectives in gender studies, feminism, and gay studies, Homosexuality in the Muslim World includes cultural and historical analyses of the entire Islamic world, not just the so-called Middle East. Essays show both age-stratified patterns of homosexuality, as revealed in the erotic and romantic poetry of medieval poets, and gender-based patterns, in which both men and women might, to varying degrees, choose to live as members of the opposite sex. The contributors draw on historical documents, literary texts, ethnographic observation and direct observation by both Muslim and non-Muslim authors to show the considerable diversity of Islamic societies and the existence of tolerated gender and sexual variances.</p></p><p><b>Will Roscoe</b> is the award-winning author of <i>The Zuni Man/Womanand Queer Spirits: A Gay Men's Myth Book</i> and the editor of <i>Living the Spirit: A Gay American Indian Anthology and Radically Gay: Gay Liberation in the Words of its Founder by Harry Hay</i>.<br><br><b>Stephen O.

First serial, New Woman. Tour.</p><p>"Supersexual" women, according to the authors, have erotic experiences approaching spiritual ecstasy. Their 86 interviews describe a sense of oneness with themselves, with their lovers and with the universe. Some speak of "zooming into hyperspace," others get "lost in the stars." Scantling, a sex therapist and assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine, and Browder, a contributing editor of New Woman , claim that supersexual women, in their everyday lives, tend to empower themselves, choose their own path and enjoy clarity of mind and spirit. The authors link their subjects' purported erotic rapture to an ability to become fully absorbed in the moment and to a keen enjoyment of imagery and fantasy. The women's own descriptions of their intense sexual experiences are the most interesting and credible part of this upbeat self-help manual.

She is the author of 25 other novels.</p>Dumnonia is the most civilized kingdom in Britain, but in the northeast, in January, it looks no tamer than the wilds of Caledonia. The fields are swallowed by the snow, with only the stubble tips showing pale above the drifts, and the sky is drained of color and seems to weigh upon the heavens. Beyond the cultivated lands-in the case of my family, beyond the river Fromm-lies the forest, dark branches and white snow mingling to form a lead-gray cloud along the horizon, mile upon mile of silence and the panting of wolves. In the summer, men and women ignore the forest. Fields are tended and the produce is brought to market, the oxen draw the ploughs, the horses the carts-but in the winter the wilderness hanging beyond the river looms large in the mind. Life is quieter, and a ghost story which a man laughed at in the harvest season suddenly seems horribly probable, for humanity and civilization look very small and light against that ocean of the cold.<br> My cousin Goronwy and I had no love for going out to the forest in January, but it happened that our householding needed more wood. That meant a trip across the ford with the cart, and two grown men to make it, so we had gone, and spent the noon-tide hacking away at the loose brush, only occasionally pausing to glance over our shoulders. We were glad when we could turn back with the cart piled high. We crossed the river again, and paused on the home bank to let the oxen drink. Goronwy sat holding the goad, looking on the sleek backs of the beasts, who, since we were impatient, must needs take their time.<br> I looked back across the river. The water of the stream was dark with the winter, and the afternoon sun lay upon it and upon the heaped snow banks, casting horizontal beams that shone like warm bronze but gave no heat. The only sound in the world was the water whispering on the banks and the grunting of the oxen. It was three miles home, back to our householding, three miles back to the cow-byres and hearth-fires and the faces of men. The thought left my heart hungry for it, but I let my eyes drift slowly down the black river and along the trees of the opposite bank. And because of that, I saw the horseman there before he saw me. A glimpse of crimson drew my eyes from the water, and then, a mounted warrior rode openly out onto the river bank in the heavy sunlight.<br> He had a red cloak wrapped tightly round him, one hand half-extended through its fold to hold the reins. Gold gleamed from his hand, from the fastening of his cloak and the rim of the shield slung over his back; the spears tied to the saddle, and the bridle of his great white stallion caught the light like stars. He reined in his horse by the stream, and together they stood a moment as still as the trees behind them, white and crimson and gold. I felt as if I had just opened my eyes and seen a being from a song I had loved all my life, or a figure from a dream. Then the rider turned his gaze along the river, and met my own stare, and I came back to myself, and knew enough to become afraid.<br> "Goronwy!" I seized my cousin's arm.<br> "Well, and what is it...?" He followed my stare and froze.<br> The rider turned his horse and came up the far bank towards us, the stallion stepping carefully, with a light, clean stride, delicate as a cat's.<br> "Eeeeh." Goronwy nudged the oxen with the goad and jumped out of the cart. The beasts snorted, backed up, breath steaming.<br> "Do you think we can outrun him?" I asked, annoyed with Goronwy and trying to prevent all the wood from falling off with the jolts. "Oxen, against a horse like that one?"<br> "Perhaps he cannot cross the water." Goronwy's voice was low.<br> "You've laughed at tales of the Fair Ones before this."<br> "I laughed at home. Sweet Jesu preserve us now!"<br> "Oh come! He must be a traveler. If he's no bandit, he will only ask the way. And if he's a bandit, there are two of us, and we've nothing more than death to fear."<br> "I fear that enough, without the other." The oxen shambled away from the bank, and Goronwy leapt back into the cart. "But who'd travel in winter? This far from a road?"<br> The rider reached the ford and turned his horse to the water. The stream was not deep, and came no higher than the animal's knees, though the horse tossed its head at the coldness. Goronwy gave a little hiss and sat still again. If the rider could cross the water, perhaps he was not a spirit. Or perhaps he was. Either way, we could not outrun him.<br> He reached the home bank and rode up beside us and, as he did so, the sun dropped below the tree-line and covered us with criss-crossing shadows. I saw more clearly as the dazzle and glitter vanished, and could have cried for disappointment after such a shining vision. The horse, though splendid, had a long, raw gash across its chest, its bones showed through the hide, and its legs and shoulders were streaked with mud. The rider's clothes were very worn, the red cloak tattered and dirty, the hand on the reins purple with cold. His black hair and beard were matted and untrimmed, and he had clearly not washed for a long time. He might be a lost traveler, he might well be a bandit, but...<br> I met his eyes, and was shaken again. Those eyes were dark as the sea at midnight, and there was something to their look that set the short hairs upright on my neck. I crossed myself, wondering whether Goronwy might be right. My father always said that the tales of the People of the Hills were so many lies, and yet I had never seen a look like that on a human face.<br> The rider smiled at my gesture, a bitter smile, and leaned over to speak to us. He had drawn his sword, and rested it across his knees so that we could look at it as he spoke. It looked a fine, sharp sword.<br> "My greetings to you," said the rider. His voice was hoarse, hardly above a whisper. "What land is this?"<br> I saw Goronwy's hand relax a little on the ox-goad, and then he, too, crossed himself before replying, "Dumnonia, Lord. Near Mor Hafren. Do you ask because you have lost your road?" He was eager to give directions.<br> The stranger said nothing to the question, only looked at the fields beyond us. "Dumnonia. What is that river, then?"<br> "The Fromm. It joins Mor Hafren a bit beyond two miles from here. Lord, there is a Roman road some twelve miles eastwards of here..."<br> "I do not know of your river. Is the land beyond close-settled?"<br> "Closely enough." Goronwy paused. "Baddon is not far from here. There is a strong lord there, and his warband."<br> The rider smiled bitterly again. "I am not a bandit, that you must threaten me with kings and warbands." He looked at us, considering. "What is your name, man?"<br> Goronwy rubbed his wrist, looked at the oxen, glanced back at the sword. "Goronwy ap Cynydd," he admitted at last.<br> "So. And you?"<br> "Rhys ap Sion," I answered. It might be unwise to offer names, but we could hardly avoid it. I again met the man's eyes, and again I felt cold, and wondered if we were endangering our souls. But I thought the man human. He must be.<br> "So then, Goronwy ap Cynydd and Rhys ap Sion, I have need of lodgings tonight, for myself and for my horse. How far is it to your householding?"<br> "My lord, our householding is poor..." Goronwy began, a trifle untruthfully, since we are one of the first clans about Mor Hafren.<br> "I can pay. How far is it?"</p><h2>Ox</h2><p>Science fiction novel by Piers Anthony.

The discoveries made at this site, now the modern town of Luxor, are responsible for much of our knowledge of ancient Egyptian civilization. After excavating and researching the city of Thebes for many years, Nigel and Helen Strudwick here offer the first comprehensive introduction to it, one that will be welcomed by both armchair travelers and visitors to that popular tourist destination. Handsomely illustrated, the book features eighty photographs&#x2015;thirty in color&#x2015;and twenty maps and plans.</p><p>After reviewing the topography of the site, the Strudwicks recount the history of Thebes from the city's rise in the late Old Kingdom to the peak of its power in the New Kingdom and to its gradual decline in the Greco-Roman period. They discuss the central role played by the gods in the community's religious life, and take us on a tour of the great temples of Karnak and Luxor on the East Bank of the Nile and of the temples and tombs of kings, queens, princes, and ordinary individuals on the West Bank.</p><p>Drawing on their intimate acquaintance with ancient Egyptian society, the authors re-create the lives of Thebans during the New Kingdom. They conclude by assessing Greek, Roman, Coptic, and Islamic influences on the area as it exists today and by providing an overview of the archaeological research undertaken there.</p></p><p><p>NIGEL STRUDWICK is an Egyptologist at the University of Cambridge. He and HELEN STRUDWICK have been working at Luxor, mainly in the Tombs of the Nobles, for over twelve years.

She has been hailed as a literary prodigy and her novel as "an explosive debut" (<i>Emma Magazine</i>). Now, <i>Broken Glass Park</i> makes it's first appearance in English in Tim Mohr's masterful translation.&nbsp;<br><br> The heroine of this throughly contemporary novel is Sascha Naimann. Sascha was born in Moscow, but now lives in Berlin with her two younger siblings and, until recently, her mother. She is precocious, independent, street-wise, and, since her stepfather murdered her mother several months ago, an orphan. Unlike most of her companions, she doesn't dream of escaping from the tough housing project where they live. Sascha's dreams are different: she longs to write a novel about her beautiful but&nbsp;na�ve mother and she wants to end the life of Vadim, the man who brutally murdered her. <br><br>Sascha's story, as touching as any in recent literature, is that of a young woman consumed by two competing impulses, one celebrative and redemptive, the other murderous. In a voice that is candid and self-confident, at times childlike and at others all too mature, Sascha relates the struggle between those forces that can destroy us, and those that lead us out of sorrow and pain back to life.<br><br>Germany's <i>Freundin Magazine</i> called <i>Broken Glass Park</i> "a gripping portrayal of life on the margins of society." But Sascha's story does not remain on the margins; it goes straight to the heart of what it means to be young, alive, and conscious in these first decades of the new century.<br><br>A finalist for the prestigious&nbsp;<i>Ingeborg Bachmann Prize</i><br>Now an award-winning motion picture with planned US release in 2015.</p><p>Russian-born&nbsp;<b>Alina Bronksy</b>&nbsp;is the author of&nbsp;<i>Broken Glass Park</i>&nbsp;(Europa, 2010);&nbsp;<i>The Hottest Dishes of the Tartar Cuisine</i>&nbsp;(Europa, 2011), named a Best Book of 2011 by&nbsp;<i>The Wall Street Journal</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Huffington Post</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Publisher's Weekly</i>; and&nbsp;<i>Just Call Me Superhero</i>&nbsp;(Europa, 2014).<br><br><b>Tim Mohr </b>spent the 1990s as a club DJ in Berlin and much of the next decade as a staff editor at <i>Playboy </i>magazine.

Levinson</b>, a psychologist, was one of the founders of the field of&nbsp;positive adult development.&nbsp;Levinson's two most prominent publications were his series of books entitled,&nbsp;<i>The Seasons of a Man's Life</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Seasons of a Woman's Life.</i>&nbsp;Although controversy surrounds his publications, both books remain promising and highly influential within the field of psychology. Levinson&nbsp;died in 1994 shortly after finishing <i>The Seasons of a Woman's Life </i>which was then published in 1996.Levinson's earlier work, The Seasons of a Man's Life (LJ 4/1/78), is a classic of adult development studies. It also has had a profound popular impact as the basis for Gail Sheehy's Passages (LJ 5/15/76), a reworking of Levinson's research. The current book is something of a disappointment. The main thesis?that the 45 women interviewed, like the men in the earlier book, went through alternating periods of tumultuous "structure building" followed by relatively stable "maintenance" periods?is not well supported by the extensive quotations from the women themselves. Instead, they seem to be constantly in the process of defining themselves and their needs and attempting to carve out space for self-expression in lives filled with heavy demands from work and family life. This is not as important a book as The Seasons of a Man's Life but much more thoughtful than Passages. (Sheehy's latest, New Passages, LJ 8/95, concerns the years beyond 50, which Levinson does not cover.)

Each poem captures a brief moment or an unusual perspective: from the mysterious nature of the fox, to the quiet stillness of a dead mouse left on the doorstep, to the power and raw ferocity of the tiger. The art reflects the shifting moods of the work deftly, allowing both to compel readers. Whether read aloud or scanned silently, this lovely book shines with the same qualities as the previous collection.

The five plays are: &#34;In the Beginning: B.C. 4004&#34; (In the Garden of Eden); &#34;The Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas: Present Day&#34;; &#34;The Thing Happens: A.D. 2170&#34;; &#34;Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman: A.D. 3000&#34;; and, &#34;As Far as Thought Can Reach: A.D. 31,920&#34;. The plays were published with a preface titled The Infidel Half Century, and first performed in 1922 by the New York Theatre Guild at the Garrick Theatre.</p><p>BERNARD SHAW was born in Dublin in 1856. Although essentially shy, he created the persona of G. B. S., the showman, satirist, controversialist, critic, pundit, wit, intellectual buffoon and dramatist. Commentators brought a new adjective into English: Shavian, a term used to embody all his brilliant qualities. After his arrival in London in 1876 he became an active Socialist and a brilliant platform speaker. He wrote on many social aspects of the day: on Common Sense about the War (1914), How to Settle the Irish Question (1917) and The Intelligent Woman&#39;s Guide to Socialism and Capitalism (1928). He undertook his own education at the British Museum and consequently became keenly interested in cultural subjects. Thus his prolific output included music, art and theatre reviews, which were collected into several volumes such as Music in London 1890-1894 (3 vols, 1931); Pen Portraits and Reviews (1931); and Our Theatres in the Nineties (3 vols, 1931). He also wrote five novels and some shorter fiction, including The Black Girl in Search of God and Some Lesser Tales and Cashel Byron&#39;s Profession, both published in Penguin&#39;s Bernard Shaw Library. He conducted a strong attack on the London theatre and was closely associated with the intellectual revival of British theatre. His plays fall into several categories: `Plays Pleasant&#39;; `Plays Unpleasant&#39;; comedies; chronicle-plays; `metabiological Pentateuch&#39; (Back to Methuselah, a series of plays); and `political extravaganzas&#39;. Bernard Shaw died in 1950.</p><h2>BUSH FLYING</h2><p>Offers readers a kaleidoscope of aviation stories from former bush pilot Robert Grant.

The Kabbalah is a rich tradition of repeated attempts to achieve and portray direct experiences of God: its twelfth-and thirteenth-century beginnings in southern France and Spain are probed in Origins of the Kabbalah, a work crucial in Scholem's oeuvre. The book is a contribution not only to the history of Jewish medieval mysticism but also to the study of medieval mysticism in general and will be of interest to historians and psychologists, as well as to students of the history of religion.</p></p><p>Gershom Scholem's <i>Origins of the Kabbalah</i> provides a painstakingly detailed history of Kabbalah's rise among medieval French and Spanish Jews, describes the first publication of Jewish mystical texts, and investigates the growth of their influence on Jewish religious life. The book also doubles back to describe secret traditions of Jewish Gnosticism, which describe a Creation story so numerological and esoteric it makes the New Testament book of Revelation look as simple and straightforward as a Saturday-morning cartoon. This book is much denser than Scholem's excellent <i>On the Kabbalah and its Symbolism</i>, but for readers with a basic knowledge of Kabbalah, it shouldn't be rough going. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>The Practical Geologist</h2><p>From exploring the basic principles of geology to starting a rock and mineral collection, <i>The Practical Geologist</i> is the perfect introduction to the world of earth science. <p> Beginning with a history of the earth's formation and development, this book explores the substances that compose the planet, movements within the earth, the surface effects of weather and water, and underground landscapes. </p><p> It shows you how to search for, identify, and extract samples of various rocks and minerals, and for each rock and mineral type there is a brief mineralogy and explanation of its locations.

He took part in the 1985 and 1987 British Open University/Earthwatch expeditions to the Askja caldera in central Iceland. Previous books include <i>After Man: A Zoology of the Future, The New Dinosaurs, Man After Man,</i> and <i>Time Exposure.</i><b>Chapter 1</b> <p> <b>WHAT IS A PRACTICAL GEOLOGIST?</b> </p><p> <i>Geology -- the science of the Earth. It is a study that incorporates all the other sciences and binds them together in one all-embracing subject.</i> </p><p> Literature gives us some guides. In Saint Ronan's Well by Sir Walter Scott, written in 1823, Meg Dodds, the prickly landlady of Cleikum Inn, refers to those of her guests who: </p><p> </p><blockquote><i>"rin uphill and down dale, knapping the chucky stanes to pieces wi' hammers, like sae mony road-makers run daft, to see how the world was made."</i></blockquote> <p> In A Study in Scarlet (1887), Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, speaking through Dr. Watson, lists Sherlock Holmes' accomplishments and his limitations. In the list we read: </p><p> </p><blockquote><i>"Knowledge of Geology -- Practical, but limited. Tells at a glance different soils from each other. After walks has shown me splashes upon his trousers, and told me by their colour and consistence in what part of London he had received them."</i></blockquote> <p> Here we have two aspects of the science of geology -- the academic and the utilitarian. The former represents knowledge for its own sake, while the latter knowledge is turned to some creative purpose. Both aspects involve practical work -- going out to find the knowledge in the first place. </p><p> Observational geology such as this has a long history. Greek scholars such as Pythagoras (c 580-500 BC) and Herodotus (c 485-425 BC) both noted the presence of fossil seashells high up in mountains and drew the conclusion that geographies were very different in times past. This early surge of interest in geology vanished during the Dark Ages and did not surface again in the West until the Renaissance in the 15th century. At this time technology and the arts began to blossom, and the necessity of supplying the raw materials for these new activities led to an interest in the formation of minerals. In 1556 the German mineralogist Georgius Agricola published <i>De Re Metallica</i> in which he describes the formation of metal ores in veins in a manner that was well ahead of his time. </p><p> The observations made over the next century or two led to some erroneous theories. The presence of crystals in some igneous rocks suggested to Abraham Gottlob Werner (1749-1817), Professor of Mining and Mineralogy at Freiberg, that all rocks had been deposited from solution as a vast primordial ocean had evaporated. This view -- the Neptunian view -- became geological orthodoxy. </p><p> <b>The value of fieldwork</b> </p><p> Throughout history the observations of the Earth's structure and composition have been misinterpreted, and it is only by diligent field work and increasingly precise experimentation that the more realistic theories have been developed. </p><p> One of the pioneers of utilitarian geology was English canal engineer William Smith (1769-1839). During the course of his work he realized that the different layers of rocks through which he excavated his ditches and tunnels could be identified by the kinds of fossils that they contained. Using this information, he was able to construct the first geological map and, with his book <i>Strata Identified by Organized Fossils,</i> initiated the science of stratigraphy. </p><p> Nowadays the classic study of geology has combined with such related subjects as meteorology, oceanography, astronomy, geophysics, and geochemistry, to become the all-embracing discipline of Earth Science. For the professionals, the practical work is done with highly sophisticated equipment. Drills penetrate the surface of the Earth and bore rock samples from deep within the crust. The structure of the underground rocks can be studied by setting off explosions and recording the patterns of reflected shock waves, analyzing the results by computer. Infra-red photography from aircraft and satellites can show chemical differences in vegetation that reveal the nature of the underlying rocks. Sonar waves bounced off the ocean floor can give resolute pictures of the landscape. Sensitive gauges can measure the electrical properties of soil and rocks, and determine if an exploitable water supply lies beneath. Instruments can detect tiny variations in the Earth's gravitational field which can suggest the presence of workable metal deposits. It is all a long way from hammers and mud stains. </p><p> With the great surge of 20th-century knowledge and the wealth of books on Earth Science -- at both the academic and the popular level -- it has become possible to learn all that is known about the nature and the workings of the Earth without moving from one's armchair. Yet practical geology for the amateur is far from dead. Studying the rocks as they outcrop and collecting new specimens will always add to the mounting knowledge of the Earth. And nothing can quite compare with the exhilaration of tramping up a deserted mountainside to observe the folds and faults in the exposed rock, or with the joy of splitting open a boulder to find a crystal of garnet or a trilobite fossil that has never before been exposed to the daylight. </p><p> Copyright � 1992 by Quarto Inc</p></p><h2>Fire Me Up (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 2)</h2><p>Aisling Grey is back-and in more trouble than ever. She thought being a courier would be easy. It&#39;s not. She thought being a Guardian would come naturally. It doesn&#39;t. She thought she could get out of being a wyvern&#39;s mate. She can&#39;t. And she never thought she&#39;d be irresistible to men. But she is.</p><p>Katie MacAlister lives in the Pacific Northwest with her husband and dogs, and can often be found lurking around online game sites.&#x201c;You&#x2019;d think that Hungary would see the light as far as secondhand smoke is concerned, wouldn&#x2019;t you? I probably lost at least thirty percent of my lung capacity on the trip from the airport.&#x201d;<p>I didn&#x2019;t even glance at the massive hairy black form at my side as we disembarked from the train on a cloud of cigarette smoke. Instead, I said through my teeth, &#x201c;Language!&#x201d;</p><p>Two big brown eyes opened wide with surprise.</p><p>&#x201c;Stop it,&#x201d; I hissed, glancing quickly around us to see if anyone had overheard. We were elbow to elbow with what appeared to be half the population of Hungary, all intent on going to the same place at the same time as us. Luckily, no one seemed to be paying attention to a huge black dog and its unexceptional owner. I took a firm grip on Jim&#x2019;s leather leash, wrapping it around the wrist on my left hand as I used my right to tug on the big suitcase on wheels that kept clipping my heels.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, right, I forgot. Ixnay on the alkingtay. Bowwow. Arf. Bark bark. Hummina hummina hummina.&#x201d;</p><p>I glared at the demon in Newfoundland dog form that stood beside me as we struggled through the huge crowds at Budapest&#x2019;s main train station. We moved slowly forward with the rest of the lemmings, part of the <i>shuffle, stop, shuffle, stop</i> pattern of movement that characterized a large number of people trying to pass through a narrow opening.</p><p>Jim&#x2019;s eyebrows rose at my look. &#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You are talking,&#x201d; I answered, more or less grinding the words. &#x201c;Dogs don&#x2019;t talk, so just <i>shut...up</i>!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well!&#x201d; Jim sniffed in an injured manner as we shuffle-stopped our way forward a few more feet. I knew from the experience of having lived with Jim for the past month that my furry little demon would have an expression of profound martyrdom on its face, an expression not at all common to most Newfies but one that Jim had perfected during our relatively short time together. &#x201c;That wasn&#x2019;t a direct order, was it? Because you didn&#x2019;t say, &#x2018;Dammit, Jim, I said shut the farking haitch up!&#x2019; which, of course, is what you normally say when you want me to shut up. And I know <i>that&#x2019;s</i> a command, because you only say &#x2018;farking haitch&#x2019; when you&#x2019;re really PO&#x2019;d. So I thought I&#x2019;d better check whether or not that last &#x2018;shut up&#x2019; was a direct order or just a hopeful desire on your part.&#x201d;</p><p>I stood in the center of the Keleti train station surrounded by hundreds of people&#x2014;nice, normal people, people who never once thought about things like demons, and demon lords, and Guardians, and all of the strange beings that populated the L&#x2019;au-del�, the Otherworld&#x2014;and I wondered for the hundredth time whether if I tried really hard I could send Jim back to the fiery depths of Hell.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; it answered my unasked question before I could do so much as level another squinty-eyed glare at it. &#x201c;You tried three times to send me back. The last time cost me a toe. My favorite one, too. How you can make a toe disappear right off my foot is beyond me, but the point is that I&#x2019;m not going to risk another unbalanced paw just so you can play Junior Guardian. I&#x2019;m staying put until you get yourself a mentor and figure out that whole sending-me-back thing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Will you stop answering questions before I ask them, stop telling me what to do, and above all, <i>stop talking</i>?&#x201d;</p><p>As crowded as the platforms were, the air filled with fumes from the fast-food restaurants that lined the main section of the station, not to mention the ripe odor of a couple of hundred people who&#x2019;d been crushed into a busy train on a hot August day, as well as the noise those very same hot, sweaty people made as they tried to escape the station&#x2014;despite all that, my words managed to penetrate the miasma of sound and echo with a strange piercing quality off the tiled walls.</p><p>Several heads swiveled to look back at us. I smiled somewhat grimly at all of them. A hurt look filled Jim&#x2019;s brown eyes as it sniffed, with studied indifference, the butts of the man and woman in front of us.</p><p>We shuffled forward another few feet.</p><p>&#x201c;So, <i>that</i> was an order?&#x201d;</p><p>I sighed, my shoulders slumping in defeat. I was hot, tired, jet-lagged from the flight from Portland to Amsterdam to Budapest, and to be honest, Jim&#x2019;s presence&#x2014;although annoying in many ways&#x2014;was more than a little reassuring considering just who else was occupying the same continent on which I now found myself.</p><p>The memory of glittering green eyes filled with smoky desire rose with no difficulty to dance before me but was squelched with a much greater effort. &#x201c;No, it&#x2019;s not an order,&#x201d; I said softly. &#x201c;At least not until we&#x2019;re through this crowd. I doubt if anyone can even see you, let alone notice that your mouth is moving.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I told you to get me that ventriloquist tape I saw on TV.&#x201d;</p><p>The mass of humanity rippled forward, then halted again. I stood on my tiptoes and peered around the big sun hat of the woman in front of me and caught sight of what was holding us up. At the far end of the platform, where the passage narrowed to one open exit to the taxi ranks and passenger pickup areas, several men in security uniforms had stopped the crowd as a couple of VIPs were escorted off the train.</p><p>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; Jim asked. &#x201c;Dead body? Someone throw himself in front of the train? Are there splattered body parts everywhere? Did you remember to bring your digital camera?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You are a sick, sick demon. There are no body parts, splattered or otherwise. It&#x2019;s just&#x201d;&#x2014;I craned my neck&#x2014;&#x201c;just a woman and a couple of guys in really expensive-looking designer clothes. They&#x2019;re probably movie stars or politicians or something.&#x201d; The crowd shimmered as a second exit was opened up, the mass of travelers undergoing mitosis as one part of the crowd headed for the new exit. Sweat trickled down my back, dampening the tendrils of hair that had escaped my ponytail until they clung to my neck. I was starting to get light-headed from the heat, the pressure of so many bodies, and the lack of sleep during the twelve hours it had taken to get from Portland to Budapest. I had to get out of there.</p><p>&#x201c;Come on. I think I see a break.&#x201d; I pushed Jim toward the slight opening next to a couple of kids decked out in Goth gear who were sucking the tongues out of each other&#x2019;s head, jerking the suitcase behind me, apologizing under my breath as I jostled elbows, backs, and sides and squished forward. &#x201c;Why I thought coming here was such a good idea is beyond me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Makes sense to me,&#x201d; Jim answered a bit distractedly as it smelled people, luggage, and the litter on the ground with the same unbiased interest. The crowd thinned dramatically as people scattered once they made it past the bottleneck of the exit. &#x201c;You need training. Budapest is where it&#x2019;s happening. Hey, when are we going to eat?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I could have had a nice vacation in the Bahamas, but oh, no, I had to come&#x2014;&#x201d; My feet stopped moving. They simply stopped moving as my eyes bugged out of my head, my heart ceased beating, and my brain, usually a reliable and trustworthy organ, came to an abrupt and grinding halt. With no obstructing crowd remaining, the group of people standing just outside the floor-to-ceiling glass windows on the west side of the train station was perfectly visible to me.</p><p>Jim stopped and looked back at me, one furry black eyebrow cocked in question at my abbreviated statement. &#x201c;You aren&#x2019;t using crude sexual slang, are you? No, you can&#x2019;t be, because I know for a fact you haven&#x2019;t been gettin&#x2019; any since we left Paris.&#x201d;</p><p>Slowly, I blinked to make sure I wasn&#x2019;t seeing things, my stomach turning somersaults, my whole being riveted on the scene just outside the station.</p><p>Jim turned to see what held me in such thrall. &#x201c;Wow. Talk about speaking of the great horned one. I must be psychic or something. What&#x2019;s <i>he</i> doing in Budapest?&#x201d;</p><p>It hurt to breathe. It hurt to think. It just hurt, period. I felt like someone had used me as a punching bag for a few hours, every atom of my body pulled so tight I thought I was going to explode into a million little pieces.</p><p>Outside the window a small clutch of people stood before a long, glistening black limousine, evidently there to welcome the VIPs from the train. They consisted of three men and one woman&#x2014;all Asian, all dressed in red and black. The men wore black slacks with open-necked shirts in different shades of red, while the woman looked as if she&#x2019;d just stepped from the cover of Beijing <i>Vogue</i>. She was tall and willowy, had long, straight glossy black hair that reached to her waist, wore a black miniskirt and a red leather bustier, all carried off with an effortless grace that spoke of years spent in expensive Swiss finishing schools.</p><p>But it was one of the men greeting the VIPs who caught and held my attention. The wind rippled the dark forest green silk of his shirt so that it outlined the lovely curves of his muscular chest and arms. That same wind was responsible for his dark hair, longer than I had remembered it, ruffling back off a brow graced by two ebony slashes that were his eyebrows. Despite the heat of the August afternoon, he wore leather pants&#x2014;<i>tight</i> leather pants&#x2014;the garment glistening in the sun as if it had been painted on his long legs and adorable derri�re as he made a courtly bow to the VIPs.</p><p>&#x201c;Drake,&#x201d; I said on a breath, my body suddenly tingling as if it was coming to life after a long, long sleep. Even his name left my lips sensitized, the sound of that one word strange after its banishment from my life four weeks ago.</p><p>Four weeks? It seemed more like a lifetime.</p><p>Jim gave me a long, appraising look. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not going to go all Buffy/Angel on me, are you? Mooning around bemoaning the forbidden love that cannot be? Because if you are, I&#x2019;m finding myself a new demon lord. Love I can take, but mooning is not in my contract.&#x201d;</p><p>I started toward the window, unable to help myself, my body suddenly a mass of erogenous zones that wanted more than anything on this earth to place itself in Drake&#x2019;s hands. His lovely long-fingered, extremely talented hands.</p><p>&#x201c;Aisling Grey.&#x201d;</p><p>The sound of my name brought me out of the trance. I swallowed hard and looked around, my mind a muddle of desire and lust and erotic memories that damn near brought me to my knees. Names, as I have had opportunity to point out, have power, and Jim&#x2019;s invoking my name had the ability to snap me out of something I had spent every night praying for strength against.</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks, Jim.&#x201d; Slowly I gathered my wits and determination, thankful that in the hustle and bustle of the train station no one had noticed a deranged, lust-crazed woman and her demon in talking-dog form. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t quite know what came over me.&#x201d;</p><p>It raised an expressive eyebrow. &#x201c;<i>I</i> know.&#x201d;</p><p>I dragged my eyes from the sight of Drake and his men waving the VIPs toward the limo. I hauled my wheeled suitcase forward and out the doors, purposely turning my back to the scene that had held such interest, Jim pacing silently beside me. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m OK now. It was just a little aberration. I told you when we left Paris that things between Drake and me were over. It just took me by surprise seeing him here, in Budapest. I had assumed he&#x2019;d still be in France.&#x201d; Safe. Several hundreds of miles away. In a completely different country, living out his life without me.</p><p>&#x201c;Uh-huh. Right. Tell it to the tail, Aisling.&#x201d;</p><p>I ignored my smart-mouthed demon as we joined the end of a queue for taxis. The handful of people ahead of us laughed and chatted gaily, just as if their world hadn&#x2019;t come to a grinding halt, whereas mine...I glanced back at the limo. Drake was overseeing P�l, one of his men, loading the matched set of luggage in the back of the glossy car. Bustier Woman was speaking to one of her contingent, suddenly calling for Drake. I narrowed my eyes as he strolled toward her with the same fluid, coiled power that sent shivers of delight down my back.</p><p>Had. Once. Now, of course, it did nothing for me. Nothing at all.</p><p>I sighed. Jim stuck its snout in the bag of the elderly couple in front of us, saying softly, &#x201c;That was a pretty pathetic sigh. It had a lot of meat to it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; I answered, trying not to grind my teeth as the woman put her hand on Drake&#x2019;s silk-clad arm, no doubt caressing his wonderful steely bicep. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s really bad when you can&#x2019;t even lie convincingly to yourself.&#x201d;</p><p>Jim pulled its head from the bag to look at me, its eyes opening wide suddenly as it made an odd combination of a bark and a warning. &#x201c;Behind you!&#x201d;</p><p>I dropped its leash and spun around in a crouch, half expecting an attack of some sort, but finding instead that my suitcase had attracted the attention of three street gypsies, all of whom obviously had the intention of lightening the load of my possessions. &#x201c;The amulet!&#x201d; I screeched, throwing myself on top of the half-opened bag.</p><p>The biggest of the thieves, a young man who looked to be about nineteen, jerked the bag out from underneath me, his accomplices pulling on the outer flap so that it peeled back like a ripe banana. I lunged toward the small brown leather amulet bag that was stuffed into my underwear. &#x201c;Hey! Let go! Police!&#x201d; My fingers closed around the bag just as the youngest thief, a girl of about fifteen or so, grabbed it, but I had not survived my Uncle Damian&#x2019;s wrath concerning the loss of a valuable antiquity for nothing. I had to save this one at all costs. I jerked the amulet free just as someone behind me shouted. The street gypsies snatched up handfuls of my things&#x2014;pants, shoes, and my cosmetic case&#x2014;before racing off in three different directions.</p><p>The wind, coming off the nearby Danube, flirted with the opened suitcase, decided it liked the look of my newly purchased satin undies, and scooped up several pairs, sending them skittering down the sidewalk. The elderly couple who had been in front of us helped me gather the remaining clothes that had been knocked out as the gypsies made their snatch and grab, repeating soft assurances that I didn&#x2019;t understand. I left Jim to guard the luggage as I ran down the sidewalk, the amulet still in my hand. I plucked my underwear from a phone booth, a magazine stand, and a newspaper box. One last pair, trembling next to a garbage bin, suddenly spun upward in a gust and flew a few feet down the sidewalk, their flight coming to a swift end as the pink satin and lace material wrapped itself in a soft caress around a man&#x2019;s leg.</p><p>A man&#x2019;s leather-clad leg.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, god,&#x201d; I moaned, closing my eyes for a second, knowing exactly who owned that leg. Why me? Why did this sort of thing have to happen to me? Why couldn&#x2019;t anything in my life ever be simple? When I looked again, Drake was holding my panties in his hand, his head slowly turning as he scanned the crowd until he saw me clutching a handful of underwear.</p><p>Any thoughts of escaping undetected died in that moment. The woman who had been about to get into the limo paused and raised a beautifully arched eyebrow at him, her dark eyes sliding over me in cool consideration. She was perfect in every way&#x2014;flawless complexion, hair glossy and straight, her assets displayed with a confidence I would never be able to match. Beside her, Drake stood in smoldering sensuality (his natural state), all hard lines and rugged planes and extremely droolworthy masculinity.</p><p>And then there was me, the third person in the ta...</p></p><h2>The Improbable Survivor: Yugoslavia and Its Problems, 1918-1988</h2><p>Traces the history of Yugoslavia from its formation in 1918 after World War I to the present, examining the many difficulties it has faced over the past seventy years</p><p>In this excellent short history, the author traces the growth of "the Yugoslav idea," i.e., unification, with special attention to the trauma of World War II, the Tito era (1945-1980) and prospects for the survival of Yugoslavia as a united country. Pavlowitch, a British academic, describes how the Axis conquerers not only destroyed the state but turned its ethnic components against each other in a way that was unprecedented (Croatian Fascists carried out a massacre of Serbs which, according to the author, was surpassed in savagery only by the mass extermination of Polish Jewry). He describes how Tito united these components after the war and then, following a period of subservience to the U.S.S.R. and hostility to the West, broke with Moscow in '48, sought economic aid from the U.S. and introduced Western-style consumerism accompanied by "an ersatz version of liberty." The reader is also brought up to date on the current discontent in Yugoslavia with the post-Tito leadership, rising inflationary conditions, the proliferation of workers' strikes, and the explosion of Albanian nationalism in the "federated unit" of Kosovo. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Erotics of Restraint: Essays on Literary Form</h2><p>Why do we read? What do we cherish in a book? What is the nature of a masterpiece? What do Alice Munro, Albert Camus, and the great Polish experimentalist Witold Gombrowicz have in common? In the tradition of Nabokov, Calvino, and Kundera, Douglas Glover&#x2019;s new essay collection fuses his long experience as an author with his love of philosophy and his passion for form. Call it a new kind of criticism or an operator&#x2019;s manual for readers and writers, <i>The Erotics of Restraint</i> extends Glover&#x2019;s long and deeply personal conversation with great books and their authors. With the same dazzling mix of emotion and idea that characterizes his fiction, he dissects narrative and shows us how and why it works, why we love it, and how that makes us human. Erudite and obsessively detailed, inventive, confessional, and cheeky, these essays offer a brilliant clarity, a respite in an age of doubt. They raise the bar.</p><p><p>Douglas Glover has published four novels, five story collections, and three works of nonfiction. His novel Elle won the Governor-General&#x2019;s Award for Fiction and was a finalist for the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award. It was adapted for the stage by Severn Thompson and premiered at Theatre Passe Muraille in 2016. His short fiction has appeared in <i>Best Canadian Stories</i> and <i>The Best American Short Stories</i>. He edited the annual <i>Best Canadian Stories</i> from 1996 to 2006. He published the literary magazine<i> Num�ro Cinq</i> from 2010-2017.</p><p><strong>Excerpt from <i>The Erotics of Restraint</i></strong></p><br><br><p>"English was my worst subject (next to Health) in high school right through to my second year of university when I stopped taking English. I&#x2019;d fallen afoul of the empty rule syndrome. Don&#x2019;t use the pronoun &#x201c;I&#x201d; in an essay; don&#x2019;t begin sentences with &#x201c;but&#x201d; or &#x201c;because&#x201d;; write paragraphs to the topic sentence-body text-conclusion pattern (even if it bores you to death to say the same thing three times); vary sentence structure. The trouble with these rules is that no one told me why any of them would be especially useful. </p><br><br><p> &#x201c;Vary sentence structure&#x201d; was a rule I puzzled over for years. No one explained grammar and syntax to me well enough to make useful connections. At first I thought, well, I can write long and short sentences, something like Hemingway. Then I practiced emphatic placement of important material (at the beginning or the end of the sentence, I was told) and inversion (writing the sentence backwards &#x2015; kind of fun). None of this got me anywhere because I could not join the spirit of a sentence, what emotional and factual impact I intended, with the idea of sentence structure. </p><br><br><p>I puzzled through instruction books. I discovered the wonderful distinctions between simple, compound and complex sentences and the even more mysterious cumulative and periodic sentences. I practiced writing periodic sentences until I was blue in the face without actually being able to discover how that made them interesting for readers. They weren&#x2019;t very interesting to me. And my stories did not seem any better for having good topic sentence paragraphs, long and short sentences, and a scattering of lovely periodic sentences. </p><br><br><p>The rules remained irretrievably inanimate, void of life. The nexus of intention and form escaped me. Above all the whole idea that you had to know what you were going to write before you wrote it was like a lock on my soul. It made writing drudgery. </p><br><br><p>I was writing fiction all the while and making other discoveries, for example, the fairly elementary fact that stories need drama, that they eventuate out of conflict. Not just conflicted characters, mind you. You need a character in conflict with other characters in an ongoing action. The spirit of conflict is what drives a story and illuminates character, a desire meeting a resistance. Once you have a desire (motive) and a resistance, a certain story logic follows. Spirit and form fuse. I understood this in terms of a story as a whole before I began to see that the same principle applies in sentences. </p><br><br><p>One day I happened to read an essay called &#x201c;On Some Technical Elements of Style in Literature&#x201d; by Robert Louis Stevenson. He was talking about sentences but instead of repeating the platitudes, he showed how to construct sentences on the basis of conflict. Instead of just announcing a single thesis, a sentence begins by setting out two or more contrasting ideas; the sentence develops a conflict, intensifying toward a climax, a &#x201c;knot&#x201d; Stevenson calls it, and then, after a moment of suspension, slides easily toward a close. Suddenly, I understood both how to write those lovely lengthy compound-complex sentences and also how to write paragraphs that had nothing to do with topic sentence-body-conclusion patterns (because I could construct a paragraph the way Stevenson constructs his long sentences). Suddenly writing a sentence became an exciting prospect, a journey of discovery, a miniature story with a conflict and a plot the outcome of which I might not know at the outset. </p><br><br><p>Simultaneously (really this all seems to have happened in a moment, a flash of personal insight), I was studying Alice Munro&#x2019;s short stories, trying to understand why her sentences were under contract at The New Yorker. What I finally noticed was Munro deploying the principle of conflict in much the same way Stevenson had, turning her clauses and sentences on the word &#x201c;but&#x201d; or some cognate structure (what I call a but-construction). </p><br><br><p>Here&#x2019;s an Alice Munro passage from &#x201c;Lives of Girls and Women.&#x201d; &#x201c;My mother had a book of operas. She would get it out and follow the story, identifying the arias, for which translations were provided. She had questions for Fern, but Fern did not know as much about opera as you would think she might; she would even get mixed up about which one it was they were listening to. But sometimes she would lean forward with her elbows on the table, not now relaxed, but alertly supported, and sing, scorning the foreign words.&#x201d; Four sentences, three but-constructions, and a complete inversion, at the end, of the reader&#x2019;s opinion of Fern. </p><br><br><p> &#x201c;But&#x201d; introduces the conflict, incites the plot, and opens the sentence up to a logical but unpredictable development. Not only that but the &#x201c;but&#x201d; creates content where there was none. It creates what I call aesthetic space into which the writer pours newly imagined, perhaps entirely surprising material. You don&#x2019;t have to know what you&#x2019;re going to write ahead of time if you understand that the sentence is an adventure not a fact, that it is less about communication than entertainment (in a deep sense), and that by creating then resolving an antithesis, the sentence invents something new, a fresh thought." </p></p><h2>The Gospel of the Heart</h2><p>The Gospel of the Heart helps readers gain a deeper feeling for what the Christian story offers by way both of comfort and challenge.</p><p></p><h2>Sesame Street: Elmo Goes to School!

The Vikings were Scandinavian farmers, cooks, craftsmen, merchants, sailors, traders, and explorers as well as infamous raiders of other civilizations. They left few written records, but the Bergers do a more-than-able job of introducing them. Repudiating a negative image with the statement that "most experts now believe that the Vikings were no more brutal or ruthless than other Europeans of the time," the Bergers pay tribute to the Vikings' ideals of freedom and democracy as well as their skills and courage. The many illustrations include maps, drawings, prints, and paintings from many periods in addition to color photographs of Viking artifacts and sites, some reconstructed. Most of the pictures are well chosen and are reproduced with exceptionally fine clarity and rich colors. A time line, source notes for quotations, and lists of books and Web sites conclude the volume. Visually appealing and quite informative, the book will appeal to browsers as well as young researchers. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Myths about the ruthlessness of the Norsemen are dispelled without glossing over the violence that did take place. The lasting impact of Viking culture, including the ideals of equality and democracy, may be surprising to some readers.

He chattered and scolded, now looking up inquiringly into Tarzan's face and then off into the jungle.<br>"Something is coming, Bwana," said Muviro, sub-chief of the Waziri. "Nkima has heard it."<br>"And Tarzan," said the ape-man.<br>"The big Bwana's ears are as keen as the ears of Bara the antelope," said Muviro.<br>"Had they not been, Tarzan would not be here today," replied the ape-man, with a smile. "He would not have grown to manhood had not Kala, his mother, taught him to use all of the senses that Mulungu gave him."<br>"What comes?" asked Muviro.<br>"A party of men," replied Tarzan.<br>"Perhaps they are not friendly," suggested the African. "Shall I warn the warriors?"<br>Tarzan glanced about the little camp where a score of his fighting men were busy preparing their evening meal and saw that, as was the custom of the Waziri, their weapons were in order and at hand.<br>"No," he said. "It will, I believe, be unnecessary, as these people who are approaching do not come stealthily as enemies would, nor are their numbers so great as to cause us any apprehension."<br>But Nkima, a born pessimist, expected only the worst, and as the approaching party came nearer his excitement increased. He leaped from Tarzan's shoulder to the ground, jumped up and down several times and then, springing back to Tarzan's side, seized his arm and attempted to drag him to his feet.<br>"Run, run!" he cried, in the language of the apes. "Strange Gomangani are coming. They will kill little Nkima."<br>"Do not be afraid, Nkima," said the ape-man.

At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Burroughs was a resident of Hawaii and, despite being in his late 60s, he applied for permission to become a war correspondent. This permission was granted, and so he became one of the oldest war correspondents for the U.S. during the Second World War. After the war ended, Burroughs moved back to Encino, California, where, after many health problems, he died of a heart attack on March 19, 1950, having written almost 80 novels.</p><h2>ENEMY MINE</h2><p>1st Corgi 1986 edition paperback fine In stock shipped from our UK warehouse</p><p></p><h2>God In Ruins</h2><p>WINNER OF THE 2015 COSTA NOVEL AWARD AND BESTSELLING LITERARY PAPERBACK OF 2016: NOW INCLUDING AN EXCLUSIVE SAMPLE FROM KATE ATKINSON&#39;S NEW NOVEL TRANSCRIPTION (September 2018). A God in Ruins relates the life of Teddy Todd - would-be poet, heroic World War II bomber pilot, husband, father, and grandfather - as he navigates the perils and progress of the 20th century. For all Teddy endures in battle, his greatest challenge will be to face living in a future he never expected to have. This gripping, often deliriously funny yet emotionally devastating book looks at war - that great fall of Man from grace - and the effect it has, not only on those who live through it, but on the lives of the subsequent generations. It is also about the infinite magic of fiction. Few will dispute that it proves once again that Kate Atkinson is one of the most exceptional novelists of our age.</p><p><p><strong> An Amazon Best Book of May 2015:</strong> Talk about being your own tough act to follow! Having accomplished a near miracle with <em>Life After Life</em>, in which she used a literary-do-over trope to tell the story of a British woman living between and after the two World Wars, Kate Atkinson now dares to write a companion novel that focuses on <em>Life</em>&#x2019;s heroine Ursula Todd&#x2019;s brother Teddy. Never mind that careful readers of the first book came away with the impression that Teddy most often turned up dead, in this one he&#x2019;s an old man trying to come to grips with his post-War life and with a modern world and family. Switching back and forth in time (Atkinson can&#x2019;t seem to help it...) between memories of his childhood and his present, Teddy emerges as a befuddled and somewhat stodgy old-man version of himself, a startlingly oblivious husband to stalwart Nancy and a wittily rueful father to a grown up daughter (&#x201c;Viola was the solitary arrow they had shot blindly into the future, not knowing where she would land,&#x201d; Teddy thinks. &#x201c;They should have aimed better.&#x201d;) Teddy never quite got over the War and he suspects that the &#x201c;fact&#x201d; of his being alive is as arbitrary as Ursula&#x2019;s demise(s). (&#x201c;He had been reconciled to death during the war and then suddenly the war was over and there was a next day and a next day. Part of him never adjusted to having a future.&#x201d;) Scenes from his past bring back Ursula and other characters from the earlier book so that readers who&#x2019;ve come this far with Atkinson will feel a tiny thrill of recognition; but new readers needn&#x2019;t fear they&#x2019;re missing the joke. There&#x2019;s way less gimmick here than in the earlier book, and sometimes I almost longed for more; it was so provocative. But whether read alone or as a follow up, <em>A God in Ruins</em> is a novel to savor, another beautiful, tender and sly Atkinsonian glimpse into the world of a so-called ordinary mid-century British family. <em>--Sara Nelson</em></p>Kate Atkinson won the Costa (formerly the Whitbread) Book of the Year prize with her first novel, Behind the Scenes at the Museum. Her bestselling novels include the four featuring former detective Jackson Brodie which became the BBC television series Case Histories, starring Jason Isaacs. Her 2013 novel Life After Life spent a record number of weeks on top of the bestsellers lists on both sides of the Atlantic, and won the South Bank Sky Arts Literature Prize and the Costa Novel Award, a prize Kate Atkinson won again in 2015 for A God in Ruins.

The first two of the book's eight chapters are best, covering Lucas's childhood and student filmmaking days at USC, which culminated in the 1971 masterpiece <i>THX 1138</i> and 1973's iconic <i>American Graffiti</i>. Hearn deftly portrays this heady period in Lucas's life, in which the director was furiously experimenting with the form and working inside the short-lived San Francisco filmmaking collective American Zoetrope with pals Francis Ford Coppola, master editor Walter Murch and legendary cinematographer Haskell Wexler. This section is elaborately illustrated with photographs, publicity stills and script excerpts, and the photos of young Ron Howard, Richard Dreyfuss and Lucas himself will amuse fans. Once Hearn begins to delve into Lucas's rise into the cinematic stratosphere with <i>Star Wars</i>, and the creation of his mini Hollywood in the Bay Area, however, the book fails. Hearn's worshipful tone doesn't allow him to satisfyingly explain how this long-haired rebel turned into the mini-mogul that he is today. Still, this is a crucial addition to the libraries of not just <i>Star Wars</i> aficionados but all lovers of modern cinema. <i>(Mar.)</i></p><h2>The Mormon Mirage: A Former Mormon Tells Why She Left the Church</h2><p>A former Mormon, now Christian, compares the beliefs of Mormonism and Christianity and explains why she converted</p><p></p><h2>Clash of the Titans</h2><p>Retells the story of Perseus and how he killed the Medusa and saved Andromeda from the Kraken, a huge sea monster</p><p></p><h2>New Collected Poems</h2><p>The lyric and satirical muses have kept busy with Les Murray.

He is, quite simply, the one by whom the language lives&#39;, Joseph Brodsky said.

The next forty years saw MI6 taking an increasingly important-and, until now, largely hidden-role in shaping the history of Europe and the world. This thorough, fascinating, and revelatory account draws on a wealth of archival materials never before seen by any outsider to unveil the inner workings of the world's first spy agency. <br><br> MI6's early days were haphazard but it was quickly forged into an effective organization in the crucible of World War I. During these war years, MI6 also formed ties with the United States-harbingers of a relationship that would become vital to both countries' security as the century progressed. These early years also saw the development of techniques that would become plot devices in a thousand books and films-forgery, invisible ink, disguises, concealing mechanisms, and much more. The interwar years were nominally peaceful, but Britain perceived numerous threats, all of which MI6 was expected to keep tabs on. The outbreak of World War II once again caught MI6 off balance, and high-profile blunders (and the memoirs of MI6 operatives such as Graham Greene) created an impression of ineffectiveness. At the same time, however, the service was pioneering cryptography at Bletchley Park (where the Enigma code would be broken) and devising the very methods and equipment that would inspire Ian Fleming's novels. <br><br> In a way, the aftermath of World War II was as dramatic as the war itself had been, because 1945-49 saw not only the end of the British Empire but also the emergence of a new sort of conflict-the Cold War. We witness MI6 wrestling with these epic developments as it tightens its bonds with the newly christened CIA, changes that would dictate the shape of the service-and the world-for decades to come.<br><br>Watch a Video<p></p><p> </p><p></p></p><p><strong>Keith Jeffery on Writing <i>The Secret History of MI6</i></strong> <p></p> <p> </p> <p> The British Secret Intelligence Service&#x2014;popularly known as MI6&#x2014;is the oldest established continuously surviving foreign intelligence-gathering organisation in the world. It has also historically been the most secret department of the British government. Founded in 1909, its existence was not officially acknowledged until 1994. Before then official British representatives had to pretend, sometimes with embarrassing results, that there was no such organisation as &#x2018;MI6&#x2019;, and even if there was, they &#x2018;couldn&#x2019;t possibly comment&#x2019; about it. Although the agency has had a website since 2005, few details are released about the number of people who work for it or the size of its budget, nor are any of its officers publicly avowed, with the sole exception of the Chief, whose name has been published since 1992. Unlike Britain&#x2019;s other security and intelligence organisations, MI5 (which covers domestic security, rather like the FBI) and the signals intelligence agency, the blandly-titled Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ; analogous to the NSA), SIS releases absolutely none of its departmental records to the British National Archives. For almost all of its hundred-year existence, the strict line has been taken that the super-secret work of SIS, gathering foreign intelligence from foreign sources, has been of such vital national importance that no iota of information about it could formally be released to the public. Until now. </p> <p> The writing of an officially-authorised history of SIS presents challenges for the agency and historian alike. For the outcome not to appear to be some sort of &#x2018;hack house history&#x2019; (and thus vitiate its value as a reliable, scholarly and authoritative work) the author has to be given sufficient freedom&#x2014;or licence&#x2014;to exercise his or her own critical judgments. The author, too, has to surmount the wisely sceptical assumptions of colleagues who may believe that the fact that he has been deemed suitable for the task may precisely render him unsuitable to produce a rigorous and independent history. Writing to such a commission necessarily involves accepting some constraints on what may be published, but so long as any redactions are limited to genuine matters of national security (though that itself is a matter of potentially differing judgment), and not simply to protect the agency from embarrassment, or to suppress failure or wrong-doing, it ought to be a price worth paying. It may in some degree be invidious that only a single individual is granted uniquely privileged access to what is certainly the &#x2018;Holy Grail&#x2019; of British archives, but since it is the case that for the foreseeable future no similar access will be granted to anyone else, then perhaps the risk is worth taking. </p> <i>--Keith Jeffery</i> <p></p>Keith Jeffery is a professor of British history at Queen&#x2019;s University, Belfast, and has written or edited thirteen books.</p><h2>Land of Waterfalls, Transylvania Co, North Carolina</h2><p>Text includes legends of Transylvania acompanied with black and white photographs.</p><p></p><h2>DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Pacific Northwest</h2><p><i>DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Pacific Northwest</i> will lead you straight to the best attractions the northwest coast of the USA has to offer.

He also discusses his work on such topics as the health hazards of smoking, the prophylactic effects of behavior therapy on cancer and coronary heart disease, parapsychology, astrology, and other matters. In a new foreword, written for this edition, Eysenck expresses his pleasure regarding the fact that his autobiography is now being published in the United States. He discusses how much of his scientific life has been bound up with American psychology. Also new to this American edition is a chapter titled &#34;Genius, Creativity, and Vitamins,&#34; in which Eysenck talks about the research he has worked on since his retirement in 1983.

Reissue.</p><p>* #40 in the Millennium SF Masterworks series, a library of the finest science fiction ever written. * Blood Music won the Nebula and Hugo Awards in its original shorter form. * &#39;One of the few SF writers capable of following where Olaf Stapledon led, beyond the limits of human ambition and geological time&#39;<b>1</b>--<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br><b>September 28-29</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Camped beside the mountain that should not have been there, wrapped in cold desert darkness, Edward Shaw could not sleep. He heard steady breathing from the still forms of his two companions, and marveled at their ease.<br>He had written in his notebook:<br>* * *<br>The mound is approximately five hundred meters long and half as wide, perhaps a hundred meters high, (apparently) the basaltic cinder cone of a dead volcano, covered with boulder- and cobble-sized chunks of dark black scoria and surrounded by fine white quartz sand. It is not on our maps nor in the 1991 Geosat directory. The flanks of the cone are steeper than the angle of repose, as much as fifty and sixty degrees. The weathering is haphazard at best--some parts open to the sun and rain are jet black, shiny, and other areas are only mildly rusty. There are no insects on the mound--specifically, lift any rock and you will <i>not</i> find a scorpion or millipede. There are no beer cans.<br>* * *<br>Edward, Brad Minelli, and Victor Reslaw had journeyed from Austin, Texas, to combine a little geology with a lot of camping and hiking across the early autumn desert. Edward was the eldest, thirty-three; he was also the shortest and in a close race with Reslaw to lose his hair the fastest. He stood five feet nine inches in his hiking boots, and his slender frame and boyish, inquisitive features made him seem a lot younger, despite the thinning hair. To see objects closer than two feet from his round nose, he wore gold wire-framed round-lensed glasses, a style he had adopted as an adolescent in the late seventies.<br>Edward lay on his back with his hands clasped behind his head and stared up at the clear steady immensity of the sky. Three days before, dark and gravid clouds had conspired in the flaming sunset to drop a true gully-washer into Death Valley. Their camp had been on high ground, but they had seen basketball-sized boulders slide and roll down freshly gouged channels.<br>The desert seemed once again innocent of water and change. All around the camp hung a silence more precious than any amount of gold. Not even the wind spoke.<br>He felt very large in the solitude, as if he might spread his fingers over half the land from horizon to horizon, and gather a mica coat of stars on his fingers. Conversely, in his largeness, he was also a little frightened. This inflated magnitude of self could easily be pricked and shrink to nothing, an illusion of comfort and warmth and high intellectual fever.<br>Not once in his six-year career as a professor of geology had he found a major error in the U.S. Geological Survey Death Valley charts. The Mojave Desert and Death Valley were the Mecca and Al Medina of western U.S. geologists; they had tramped over the regions for well over a century, drawn by the nakedness and shameless variety of the Earth. From its depths miners had hauled borax and talc and gypsum and other useful, unglamorous minerals. In some places, niter-lined caves wedged several hundred feet into the Earth. A spelunker need descend only twenty or thirty feet to feel the heat; creation still lay close under Death Valley.<br>There were hundreds of dead volcanoes, black or sullen red on the tan and gray and pink desert, between the resort at Furnace Creek and the small town of Shoshone, yet each one had been charted and was likely featured in some graduate research paper or another.<br>This mountain was an anomaly.<br>That was impossible.<br>Reslaw and Minelli had shrugged it off as an interesting if unique error on the maps; a misplacement, like the discovery of some new island in an archipelago, known to the natives but lost in a shuffle of navigators' charts; a kind of Pitcairn of volcanic mounds.<br>But the cinder cone was too close to routes traveled at least once or twice a year. Edward knew that it had not been misplaced. He could not deceive himself as his friends did.<br>Neither could he posit any other explanation.<br>* * *<br>They walked once again around the base of the mound at midmorning. The sun was already high in the flat, still blue sky. It was going to be a hot day. Red-haired, stocky Reslaw sipped coffee from a green-enameled Thermos bottle, a serviceable antique purchased in a rock-and-junk shop in Shoshone; Edward chewed on a granola bar and sketched details in a small black cloth-bound notebook. Minelli trailed them, idly chipping at boulders with a rock pick, his loose, lanky form, unkempt black hair, and pale skin giving him the appearance of a misplaced urban scrounger.<br>He stopped ten yards behind Edward. "Hey," he called out. "Did you see this?"<br>"What?"<br>"A hole."<br>Edward turned back. Reslaw glanced back at them, shrugged, and continued around the mound to the north.<br>The hole was about a meter wide and slanted upward into the mass of the mound. Edward had not seen it because it began in deep shadow, under a ledge illuminated by the warm rays of the sun. "It's not a flow tube. Look how smooth," Minelli said. "No collapse, no patterns."<br>"Bad geology," Edward commented. <i>If the mound is a fake, then this is the first mistake</i>.<br>"Hm?"<br>"It's not natural. Looks like some prospector got here before us."<br>"Why dig a hole in a cinder cone?"<br>"Maybe it's an Indian cave," Edward offered lamely. The hole disturbed him.<br>"Indians with diamond drills? Not likely," Minelli said with a faint edge of scorn. Edward ignored his tone and stepped on a lava boulder to get a better look up into the darkness. He pulled a flashlight from his belt and squeezed it to shine a beam into the depths. Smooth-bored matte-finish lava walls absorbed the light beyond eight or ten meters; to that point, the tunnel was straight and featureless, inclining upward at about thirty degrees.<br>"Do you smell something?" Minelli asked.<br>Edward sniffed. "Yeah. What is it?"<br>"I'm not sure..."<br>The odor was faint and smooth and sweet, slightly acrid. It did not encourage further investigation. "Like a lab smell," Minelli said.<br>"That's it," Edward agreed. "Iodine. Crystalline iodine."<br>"Right."<br>Minelli's forehead wrinkled in a mock fit of manic speculation. "Got it," he said. "This is a junkie rock. A sanitary junkie cinder cone."<br>Edward ignored him again. Minelli was infamous for a sense of humor so strange it hardly ever produced anything funny. "Needle mark," "Minelli explained in an undertone, realizing his failure. "You still think this isn't a map mistake?"<br>"If you found a street in New York City, not on any map, wouldn't you be suspicious?"<br>"I'd call up the mapmakers."<br>"Yeah, well, this place is as crowded as New York City, as far as geologists are concerned."<br>"All right," Minelli conceded. "So it's <i>new</i>. Just popped up out of nowhere."<br>"That sounds pretty stupid, doesn't it?" Edward said.<br>"Your idea, not mine."<br>Edward backed away from the hole and suppressed a shiver. <i>A new mole and it won't go away; a blemish that shouldn't be here</i>.<br>"What's Reslaw doing?" Minelli asked. "Let's find him."<br>"This-a-way," Edward said, pointing north. "We can still catch up."<br>They heard Reslaw call out.<br>He had not gone far. At the northernmost point of the mound's base, they found him squatting on top of a beetle-shaped lava boulder.<br>"Tell me I'm not seeing what I'm seeing," he said, pointing to the shade below the rock. Minelli made a face and hurried ahead of Edward.<br>In the sand, two meters from the boulder, lay something that at first glance resembled a prehistoric flying creature, a pteranodon perhaps, wings folded, canted over to one side.<br>It was not mineral, Edward decided immediately; it certainly didn't resemble any animal he had seen. That it might be a distorted plant, a peculiar variety of succulent or cactus, seemed the most likely explanation.<br>Minelli edged around the find, cautiously giving it a berth of several yards. Whatever it was, it was about the size of a man, bilaterally symmetric and motionless, dusty gray-green with touches of pastel flesh-pink. Minelli stopped his circling and simply gaped.<br>"I don't think it's alive," Reslaw said.<br>"Did you touch it?" Minelli asked.<br>"Hell no."<br>Edward kneeled before it. There was a definite logic to the thing; a kind of head two feet long and shaped rather like a bishop's miter, or a flattened artillery, shell, point down in the sand; a knobby pair of shoulder blades behind the fan-crest of the miter; short thin trunk and twisted legs in squat position behind that. Stubby six-digit feet or hands on the ends of the limbs.<br><i>Not a plant</i>.<br>"Is it a corpse, maybe?" Minelli asked. "Wearing something, like a dog, you know, covered with clothes--"<br>"No," Edward said. He couldn't take his eyes away from the thing. He reached out to touch it, then reconsidered and slowly withdrew his fingers.<br>Reslaw climbed down from the boulder. "Scared me so bad I jumped," he explained. <br>"Jesus Christ," Minelli said. "What do we do?"<br>The snout of the miter lifted from the sand and three glassy eyes the color of fine old sherry emerged. The shock was so great that none of the three moved. Edward finally took a step back, almost reluctantly. The eyes in the miter-head followed him, then sank away again, and the head nodded back into the sand. A sound issued from the thing, muffled and indistinct.<br>"I think we should go," Reslaw said.<br>"It's sick," Minelli said.<br>Edward looked for footprints, hidden strings, signs of a prank. He was already convinced this was no prank, but it was best to be sure before committing oneself to a ridiculous hypothesis.<br>Another muffled noise.<br>"It's saying something," Reslaw said. <br>"Or trying to," Edward added.<br>"It isn't really ugly, is it?" Minelli asked. "It's kind of pretty."<br>Edward hunkered down and approached the thing again, edging forward one booted foot at a time.<br>The thing lifted its head and said very clearly, "I am sorry, but there is bad news."<br>"What?" Edward jerked, his voice cracking.<br>"God almighty," Reslaw cried.<br>"I am sorry, but there is bad news."<br>"Are you sick?" Edward asked.<br>"There i...</p><h2>Decorative Wire Findings: Make Custom Clasps, Connectors, and More</h2><p>Wireworkers will create 23 truly one-of-a-kind jewelry pieces by learning to make decorative findings!

The volume maps some of the specifically local issues as well as the common ones affecting queer/trans people of colour (qtpoc). The contributions are not delimited by traditional academic style but rather draw on creative inspiration to produce knowledge and insight through various styles and formats, including poetry, essays, statements, manifestos, as well as academic mash-ups. Queering coloniality and the epistemic categories that classify people means to disobey and delink from the coloniality of knowledge and of being. At this intersection, decolonial queerness is necessary not only to resist coloniality but, above all, to re-exist and re-emerge decolonially.</p> <blockquote> <p>"The volume is more than timely. First, it contributes to the field of decolonial queer theory, second it offers a transnational approach, third it never seeks to fix categories, and finally, and more importantly, it centred on narratives of solidarity and alliance which are so important today in a world under the assault of financial capitalism, new politics of dispossession and colonization, and new politics of division and fragmentation."&nbsp;&#x2014; Fran�oise Verges (Chair Global South(s),&nbsp;College d'�tudes mondiales, Paris)</p> <p>"The brave and thoughtful pieces in this book span across 'intellectual' and 'artistic' categorisations, and together make an important contribution not only to the field of sexuality/queer studies, but also to the ongoing battle to keep such studies from racist cooptation."&nbsp;&#x2014; Dr Sarah Keenan,&nbsp;Lecturer in Law, &nbsp;Birkbeck, University of London.</p> <p>"The range and depth of these contributions make this an invaluable resource for students and researchers alike.&nbsp; Above all, these essays highlight the fact that we can no longer assume or theorize an LGBT identity or politics that is constituted outside of racialization, coloniality, place and time."&nbsp;&#x2014; Momin Rahman (Professor of Sociology,&nbsp;Trent University, Canada)</p> <p>"In a world in which colonialism and neocolonialism make their marks on sexuality as well as race and class, this rich volume shows that decolonial thinking and doing cannot be done without an attention to queer politics."&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;Roderick A.

That&#x2019;s a question Mark Moran and Mark Sceurman have enjoyed asking for years and their offbeat sense of curiosity led them to create the best-selling phenomenon, <i>Weird N.J.</i>&nbsp; But why should they stop at New Jersey when there&#x2019;s so much that&#x2019;s strange, odd, and utterly nutty all across the U.S.? So they&#x2019;ve expanded their universe, taken their act on the road, and found stories of weirdness in every state in the nation. The result is a travel guide of sorts, but to the kind of places voyagers will never find on their everyday maps. Instead, it&#x2019;s chock full of the local legends, crazy characters, cursed roads, abandoned sites, and bizarre roadside attractions. So come along and visit such unique spots as Midgetville, explore long-empty insane asylums, and go through forgotten tunnels but keep in mind that the maniacal Bunnyman just might be hiding out in one of them. Some of what&#x2019;s out there is disturbing, some of it's hilarious, but all of it is unforgettably weird.</p><p></p><h2>The Flavors of Sicily: Stories, Traditions, and Recipes for Warm-Weather Cooking</h2><p>The author of the acclaimed The Heart of Sicily brings readers back to her homeland for an enticing look at the summer life, traditions, and food of Sicily. Includes 60 recipes, two 16-page color photo inserts and halftones throughout.</p><p>f the acclaimed The Heart of Sicily brings readers back to her homeland for an enticing look at the summer life, traditions, and food of Sicily. Includes 60 recipes, two 16-page color photo inserts and halftones throughout.This small gem of a book occasionally covers some of the same ground as Lanza's The Heart of Sicily, but it doesn't suffer for it. The chapters are organized by month, from March through September, and each month begins with a description of several holidays, traditions and foods associated with it. Some of these associations are expected (e.g., Holy Week in April), but most are delightfully personal (e.g., Lanza visits the island of Pantelleria each year in June, so this month is dedicated to the famed capers, pastries and other foods of this small, rocky island). The recipes reflect Sicily's bounty of fresh vegetables and fish: Poached Sea Bass; Frittata with Bitter Greens; Rice Salad with Tomatoes, Tuna and Capers. There are also plenty of rich pastries, and these tend to be more labor-intensive. Pastry Peaches, for instance, are made by shaping the dough around walnut shell halves, then detaching them after baking and affixing two halves to each other with whipped cream to create each "peach." The recipes are fine, but the charm is in the background material. Readers will envy the pleasure Lanza and family enjoy when opening and drinking the wine her husband's grandfather started collecting in 1880, just before Europe's vineyards were ravaged by blight.

The beautiful red-haired women's-shelter volunteer was already unconscious when brought into the emergency room on Christmas Day- -the unintended gunshot victim of someone else's angry husband. Only as cool, competent physician Olivia Simon is literally holding the woman's heart in her hand, plugging the bullet wounds with her fingers, does Olivia learn that the patient is Annie O'Neill, the woman with whom her husband, Paul, has been obsessed ever since their recent move to North Carolina's Outer Banks. When Annie dies on the operating table, Olivia must first inform the stunned husband, Alec, and the couple's two children, then go home to face her own husband's grief and wrath, knowing her innocent role in Annie's death will mean the end of her marriage. Once Paul moves out, Olivia's grief at the dissolution of her marriage gradually leads her into an obsession of her own with Annie O'Neill. Called ``Saint Anne'' by the locals, the charismatic wife and mother was well-known for donating bone marrow to children with cancer, fighting to preserve historical landmarks, caring for the elderly, and otherwise performing good deeds. But as Olivia becomes more deeply involved in Annie's life and family, she learns that neither Annie nor Paul were ever what they seemed. Will Olivia learn the truth behind Annie's apparent selflessness? Will Alec and his family survive Annie's death? Will Paul recognize the self- destructive nature of his obsession and return to his now-pregnant wife? Will Olivia and Alec find happiness--with or without their mates? Such questions--along with some particularly well-drawn local characters--keep the pages turning. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Neal received his own comic strip, based on the popular TV series Ben Casey, in 1962. The strip ran until 1965 at which time Neal made the move to comics for Warren Publishing and DC Comics. Neal&#39;s realistic style on such strips as DEADMAN and GREEN LANTERN/GREEN ARROW, at odds with the more cartoony comics of the day, made him an immediate star. He became DC&#39;s premier cover artist, contributing radical and dynamic illustrations to virtually the company&#39;s entire line. Neal&#39;s work has also appeared in Marvel&#39;s X-Men, the Avengers and Thor, on paperback book covers, and on stage, as the art director for the Broadway science fiction play, Warp. In the 1970s, Neal and partner (and frequent inker) Dick Giordano started the art agency Continuity Associates out of which came, in the 1980s, Continuity Comics. Neal is the winner of several Alley, Shazam and Inkpot Awards, and was inducted into the Harvey Awards&#39; Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1999."It's completely sincere and utterly wonderful. BATMAN: ODYSSEY looks and reads like nothing else on the shelf."&#x2014;Comic Book Resources<br><br>"With each page, Adams proves that, artistically speaking, he's not missed a beat.

Then, one night she dreams of a mysterious beautiful lady shrouded by trees with branches hung with hundreds of little suns. They are oranges like the ones Maria&#39;s parents once ate in their homeland, Valencia, Spain. That very day Maria and her family plant the seeds that soon yield a magnificent orange grove and save the farm. But who was the mysterious lady who appeared in her dream and will Maria ever find her again?</p><p>Kindergarten-Grade 3&#x2013;After the failure of her father's olive crop, Mar�a fears that her family will have to leave their farm in the New World. Then one night, inspiration comes when she dreams of planting the seeds from the oranges that came from her parents' homeland of Valencia, Spain. A beautiful and mysterious woman&#x2013;Our Lady of Thanks&#x2013;enters the dream, foretelling a bountiful harvest. The next day, Mar�a convinces her family to begin planting the seeds, and soon their land is transformed into a fertile orange grove. Rich in cultural authenticity and brimming with the magical realism that is characteristic of Hispanic literature, this elegantly woven tale introduces the legend of Our Lady of Altagracia, the patron saint of the Dominican Republic. Children of all backgrounds will be drawn in by the universal themes of home and family, but the story will have particular relevance for those raised in Hispanic or Catholic cultures. With an exquisite use of watercolor and gouache, Vidal has painted colorful, yet warm illustrations that add depth to the story. An author's note offers a detailed account of the legend, personalized by actual events from the author's youth.<i>&#x2013;Debbie Lewis O'Donnell, Alachua County Library District, Gainesville, FL</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.Gr. 1-3. The Virgin Mary takes many names around the world, and in the Dominican Republic, the author's birthplace, she is <i>Nuestra Senora de la Altagracia.</i> This magical story, based on a legend of Altagracia, begins as Papa returns home from a trip to the city with an overflowing basket of oranges, like those he used to eat in his native Spain. That night, after Papa warns the family that they may have to abandon their failing olive farm, young Maria dreams of planting orange seeds, and a beautiful lady with a crown of stars, Altagracia, materializes in an orange-laden grove. The next morning, the family plants orange seeds and gives thanks to Our Lady--and sure enough, a bountiful orange crop is born. Argentina-born illustrator Vidal uses small brushes and gouache to create lovely, stylized folk-art-style paintings of the hard-working family and tropical landscapes. The tale unravels rather slowly, but this talented team evokes an enchanted, sun-kissed world where dreams, and gratitude, bear fruit.

Their work appears regularly on the cover of The Sunday Times Magazine as well as in Night&amp;Day, The Observer, and Marie Claire.In an ambitious effort that is equal parts history, sensationalized gossip and political expos&#x201a;, London Sunday Times investigative reporters Levy and Scott-Clark trace the winding path of the so-called "Stone of Heaven." The story begins in 1735, when jade-obsessed Chinese emperor Qianlong endeavors to extend China's reach into present-day Burma, reputed to contain the world's finest jade. Over time the infatuation with jade also infects French and British colonials, adventurers, Chinese gangsters, Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong, all of whom energetically loot the Imperial Court's treasures. Descriptions and provenances of legendary jade pieces (some of which are lost for centuries at a time) are given at length. Among the history's cast of characters is bad-girl Woolworth heiress Barbara Hutton, who receives a tabloid treatment of her jade collection, marriages, sexual misadventures and profligate spending. But the history, the gossip, even the sensational stories of the depredations of the indigenous tribes who fiercely protected their secret jade mines, pale in comparison to the authors' visit to Burma. Risking their lives, Levy and Scott-Clark pose as gemologists and, with guile, courage and bribery, reach Hpakant, home to the mines. There they find hundreds of thousands of destitute people virtually enslaved amid prostitution, government-sponsored heroin addiction, and "jade disease, or AIDS." The story of the quest for jade ends abruptly in a kind of hell, rendered as astutely as the excesses in this intriguing history. 40 b&amp;w photos. This book's various elements rest uneasily together; no doubt, most readers will be lured by the romance of jade, but in fact the book's strongest point is its horrifying conclusion. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Best of Taste (Williams-Sonoma)</h2><p>The hottest chefs in the food business have one thing in common, Taste, the lavish culinary magazine.

Allan is the author of over 60 books for children, much of which he collaborated on with his wife. Allan moved to London following his wife's death in 1994.<br>This British import is great fun, sure to entertain children and parents alike. The Jolly Postman goes from home to home in a fairy-tale kingdom, delivering letters to such familiar addresses as "Mr. and Mrs. Bear, Three Bears Cottage, The Woods." Every other page is an actual envelope, with a letter tucked inside. The letter to the three bears, for instance, is from Goldilocks, who apologizes for the trouble she's caused and invites Baby Bear to her birthday party. Some authors would stop with this cute concept, but the Ahlbergs have given this book their all. The story of the postman's travels is told in charming verse; the pictures are delightful, full of clever detail; and the results are frequently hilarious. (The wicked witch of "Hansel and Gretel" fame, for instance, receives a circular from Hobgoblin Supplies Ltd. which advertises such appealing products as Little Boy Pie Mix.)

Danny Delancey, a gay New York performance-artist, recalls the camp-wild days of downtown artistic gay culture before AIDS: the bars, baths, cults (for Judy G. and Callas, for McCourt's own original Kate Wayfaring and Mawdrew Czgowchwz), and the Hamptons. But it is the long soliloquized novella--``A Chance to Talk''--where everything becomes truly personalized, from the lips of Odette O'Doyle, a renowned drag-queen ballerina newly arrived from Europe and taking the train out to the South Fork in the company of Danny. Nothing goes past or surprises Odette: he/she's seen it and done it all; and McCourt lets his character talk about St. Augustine, de Kooning, the unsafe-sex young (``They're still at it, I thought, like Carolina snake-handling Baptists, besotted in their religion exactly like believers in the thoroughly discredited appendix to the Gospel of Mark: believing they can beguile the cobra and drink any deadly thing and it shall not harm them, all because they are wearing the talisman: not ankh, and not the cross, but the pink triangle''); poets like John Ashbery, James Merrill, and James Schuyler (here called ``the Skylark''); painters and transvestites and scandals. Synoptic like a gospel itself (though the news is hardly glad)--Odette's recitations are brilliant, touching, funny, self-deprecating: flamboyance warmed with wisdom. McCourt is no easy writer, but his way with disorder and sorrow--early and late- -is not to be missed. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>McCourt is nothing if not consistent. These two linked novellas give us the same characters and voices previously heard in his celebrated earlier works Kaye Wayfaring in " Avenged" and Mawdrew Czgowchwz. In the first novella, "I Go Back to the Mais Oui," Delancy, a 40-ish gay performance artist, dramatically recollects (with Firbankian abstraction, speed-queen timing and outrageous, bitchy wit) the highlights of his life over the past 25 years. The name-dropping riff cites "Jackson Pollock, the Kouros of Melanes, Judy Garland in her coffin at Campbell's, and Tito Gobbi as Scarpia." "A Chance to Talk" finds Delancey riding the milk train out to Easthampton, meeting and matching wits with the brilliant transvestite ballerina Odette O'Doyle, whose voice and opinions are just as kinetically pitched as Delancey's own. Age and AIDS give these frothy, entertaining evocations of New York's gay subculture all the melancholy resonance of a last call at the piano bar. To those who comprehend its nuances, this book will surely give pleasure; the rest of the reading public may be somewhat bewildered. A tour de force of high camp, Manhattan-style, this collection proves McCourt is a dazzling practitioner of the lost language of queens. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Unknown Legends of Rock &#39;n&#39; Roll</h2><p>(Book). For every Beatles or Stones, there are dozens of visionary rock groups who remain unsung heroes. From cult figures such as Pink Floyd&#39;s Syd Barrett (the most famous musician included here) to virtually undiscovered artists, this behind-the-scenes book with a fascinating link to online audio of 12 rare songs celebrates the best rockers in everything from &#39;50s rockabilly to &#39;90s post-punk - the unknown greats who, for one reason or another, just never made it. Features lots of photos throughout.</p><p>One man's unjustly neglected genius is the next man's appropriately unheeded fraud. Differentiating between the prodigies and the posers is one of the great joys of fans of any art form, including pop music. And this task is made easier with this book, a paean to some of rock &amp; roll's quirkiest artists. <i>All Music Guide</i> coeditor Richie Unterberger ranks among the most prolific rock critics of recent times, and he exhibits a depth of knowledge and a clear commitment to his subjects throughout this 400-page-plus study. He tracked down former members of such long-forgotten groups as Rising Storm, Savage Rose, and the Deviants for interviews. All seem to respond with unmistakable enthusiasm as they recall creating idiosyncratic music decades back. Heaven knows, a guy like Joe Docko doesn't get many opportunities to discuss his mid-'60s Mystic Tides 45s. This brings up the book's greatest strength: the light Unterberger shines on some truly secluded artists. Yes, you may have heard of Syd Barrett and Nick Drake, but even serious rock &amp; roll aficionados may be at a loss when it comes to Duffy Power and the Misunderstood. <i>--Steven Stolder</i>Richie Unterberger is also author of Urban Spacemen and Wayfaring Strangers: Overlooked Innovators and Eccentric Visionaries of '60s Rock, as well as The Rough Guide to Music USA.

These lieder have always found admiring audiences, but the poetry he chose to set them to has been widely regarded as weak and trivial. In <em>Retracing a Winter's Journey</em>, Susan Youens looks not only at Schubert's music but at the poetry, drawn from the works of Wilhelm M�ller, who once wrote in his diary, "perhaps there is a kindred spirit somewhere who will hear the tunes behind the words and give them back to me!"</p><p>Youens maintains that M�ller, in depicting the wanderings of the alienated lover, produced poetry that was simple but not simple-minded, poetry that embraced simplicity as part of its meaning. In her view, M�ller used the ruder folk forms to give his verse greater immediacy, to convey more powerfully the wanderer's complex inner state. Youens addresses many different aspects of <em>Winterreise</em>: the cultural milieu to which it belonged, the genesis of both the poetry and the music, Schubert's transformation of poetic cycle into music, the philosophical dimension of the work, and its musical structure.</p></p><p>German lieder are among the world's most exquisite works of miniature art--one singer, one pianist, one brief poem, expressing a small but profound world in the space of a minute or two--and Franz Schubert was perhaps the greatest of all lieder composers. One of his masterworks was <i>Die Winterreise</i> ("The Winter Journey"), a setting of 24 poems by Wilhelm Mueller. This book may be the definitive word on that cycle. It is sure to increase the understanding of the careful reader/listener with its explanations and insights into Schubert's work.<p> Susan Youens is J. W. Van Gorkom Professor of Music at the University of Notre Dame.

The Newford novels include<i> Spirit Walk, Memory and Dream, Trader, Someplace To Be Flying, Forests of the Heart, The Onion Girl, </i>and<i> Spirits in the Wires</i>. In addition, de Lint has published several collections of Newford short stories, including <i>Moonlight and Vines</i>, for which he won the World Fantasy Award.

It had been taken just before the Second World War in their native Mousehole--confusingly pronounced &#x201c;Mouzel&#x201d; by the locals--two gangly Cornish lads standing in front of The Ship Inn, cloth caps in hand, shy grins on their faces.<br>Dunthorn had written three book-length works of fiction, but until that day in the Gaffer&#x2019;s attic when Janey was having a dusty time of it, ferreting through the contents of old boxes and chests, she knew of only two. The third was a secret book, published in an edition of just one copy.<br><em>The Hidden People</em>was his best-known work, remembered by most readers with the same fondness that they recalled for <em>Winnie the Pooh, The Wind in the Willows</em>, and other classics of their childhood. It told of a hidden race of mouse-sized people known as the Smalls, reduced to their diminutive stature in the Middle Ages by a cranky old witch who died before her curse could be removed. Supposedly the Smalls prospered through the ages, living a hidden life alongside that of more normal-sized people right up to the present day. The book was still in print, in numerous illustrated editions, but Janey&#x2019;s favorite was still the one that contained Ernest Shepard&#x2019;s delightful pen and ink drawings.<br>The other novel was <em>The Lost Music</em>published two years after the first. While it didn&#x2019;t have nearly the success of <em>The Hidden People</em>--due no doubt to its being less whimsical and the fact that it dealt with more adult themes--its theories of music being a key to hidden realms and secret states of mind had still made it a classic in the fantasy field. It too remained in print, though there were few children who would find a copy of it under their Christmas tree, illustrated by whichever artist was currently the nadir of children&#x2019;s book illustrating.<br>Which was really a pity, Janey often thought, because in the long run, <em>The Lost Music</em>was the better book. It was the reason that she had taken up with old things. Because of it, she went back to its sources, poring over folktales and myths, discovering traditional music and finding that the references between old lore and old tunes and songs went back and forth between each other. It was a delightful exploration, one that eventually led to her present occupation.<br>For while she had no interest in writing books, she had discovered, hidden away inside herself, a real flair for the old music. She took to playing the fiddle and went wandering through tunebooks tracked down in secondhand bookshops, the tunes sticking to her like brambles on a walk across a cliff-side field. Old tunes, old names, old stories. So Dunthorn was partially responsible for who she was today--a comment that made the Gaffer laugh when she mentioned it to him once.<br>&#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t Billy smile to hear you say that now, my robin,&#x201c; her grandfather had said. &#x201c;That his writings should turn a good Cornish girl to playing Paddy music for a living--not to mention traveling around by her ownsel&#x2019; with nothing but a fiddle and a set of Scotch small pipes to keep her company.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You like my music.&#x201d;<br>The Gaffer nodded. &#x201c;And I don&#x2019;t doubt Bill would have liked it too--just as he liked his own writing. He&#x2019;d sit up and scribble by the lantern till all hours of the night sometimes--took it all very seriously, didn&#x2019;t he just?--and he&#x2019;d have admired your getting by with the doing of something you love.<br>&#x201c;He always wanted to live by his writing--writing what he pleased, I mean--but all the bookmen wanted was more fairy tales. Bill...he had more serious stories to tell by then, so he worked the boats by day to earn his living and did his writing by night--for himself, like. He wouldn&#x2019;t give &#x2018;em another book like the one about the Smalls. Didn&#x2019;t want to be writing the same thing over and over again, was what he said.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;<em>The Lost Music</em>has fairy-tale bits in it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And doesn&#x2019;t it just, my beauty? But to hear him talk, they weren&#x2019;t made-up bits--just the way that history gets mixed up as the years go by. <em>The Lost Music</em>was his way of talking about the way he believed that old wives&#x2019; tales and dance tunes and folktales were just the tangled echoes of something that&#x2019;s not quite of this world...something we all knew once, but have forgotten since. That&#x2019;s how he explained it to me, and very serious he was about it too. But then Bill had a way of making anything sound important--that was his gift, I think. For all I know he was serious about the Smalls too.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You think he really believed in things like that?&#x201d;<br>The Gaffer shrugged. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not saying yes or no. He was a sensible lad, was Bill, and a good mate, but he was a bit fey too. Solid as the ground is firm, but ever so once in a while he&#x2019;d get a funny look about him, like he&#x2019;d just seen a piskie sticking its little brown head around the doorpost, and he wouldn&#x2019;t talk then for a while--at least he wouldn&#x2019;t say much that made sense. But I never heard a man not make sense so eloquently as Bill Dunthorn could when he was of a mind to do so, and there was more than once he had me half believing in what he was saying.&#x201d;<br>Dunthorn had also written essays, short stories, travelogues, and poetry, though none of those writings survived in current editions except for two of the short stories, which were constantly being reprinted in storybook collections for children: &#x201c;The Smalls,&#x201c; which was the original version of <em>The Hidden People</em>, and &#x201c;The Man Who Lived in a Book,&#x201c; a delightful romp about a world that existed inside a book that could be reached by placing a photograph of oneself between its pages. Janey could still remember all the times she&#x2019;d put pictures of herself between the pages of her favorite books, in the very best parts, and gone to sleep, hoping to wake up in one of those magical realms.<br>&#x201c;I could use that trick now,&#x201c; she murmured to herself as she brushed the dust and cobwebs from a chest that was thrust far back under the eaves of the attic.<br>She still couldn&#x2019;t believe that Alan had left her in the lurch, right on the eve of a new tour of New England and California.<br>Things had not been going well between them this past summer, which just went to show you that one should pay more attention to the old adages because they were all based on a kernel of good solid common sense.<br>Never mix business and pleasure.<br>Well, of course. Except having a relationship with one&#x2019;s sideman seemed too perfect to not take advantage of it. Instead of leaving your lover behind, he went on tour with you. What could be better? No more lonely nights while your sideman went out with some guitar groupie and you were left alone in the hotel room because you just wanted to be <em>away</em>from the crowds for a change. Away from strangers. Away from having to put on a smiling face when you just wanted to be silly with a friend, or slouch in a corner and simply do nothing at all, without having to worry about what kind of an impression you made or left behind when you traveled on.<br>But relationships tended to erode if they weren&#x2019;t worked on, and Alan&#x2019;s and hers had been no exception. They&#x2019;d become grouchy with each other on their last tour of the Continent. Complaining, not with each other, but about each other. Mostly it was just little things, dissatisfactions and petty differences, but it began to affect the music until it got to the point where they couldn&#x2019;t work up a new arrangement of any sort without a row.<br>Argumentative was how Alan described her.<br>Perhaps she was. But she wouldn&#x2019;t see the music compromised. Improvising was fine, but not simply because he couldn&#x2019;t bother to remember an arrangement. And banging his guitar strings like they were horseshoes and his pick the hammer, that was right out. It was still her name on the tour posters. People came to see her play the music, and she meant to give them their money&#x2019;s worth. They hadn&#x2019;t come to see her sideman evenings where he made the Pogues sound like brilliant musicians.<br>And that was the real heart of Alan&#x2019;s problem. They hadn&#x2019;t come to see Alan MacDonald; they&#x2019;d come to see her.<br>&#x201c;Oh, sod him,&#x201c; she said as she dragged the dusty chest out from under the eaves.<br>Her voice rang hollowly in the attic. She wondered what the Gaffer would think to hear her sitting up here, talking to herself, but she had the house to herself. He was up in Paul, at the King&#x2019;s Arms, having a few pints with his mates. Perhaps she should have gone. Chalkie Fisher would be there and if he&#x2019;d brought along his box, they could have had a bit of a session. And after a few tunes, Jim Rafferty would take out his wee whistle and ask quietly, &#x201c;Do you know this one, then?&#x201d; just before he launched into the version of &#x201c;Johnny Cope&#x201d; that was his party piece.<br>But for once Janey knew she&#x2019;d find no solace in the music. Not with the tour still looming and her without a sideman. She had an advert in a couple of the papers, but she&#x2019;d have to go back to Jenny&#x2019;s flat in London for the a...</p></p><h2>Beginner&#39;s Guide to Embroidered Boxes</h2><p>The author&#39;s exquisite boxes are constructed simply by machine stitching layers of fabric together.

In <i>Genesis</i>, John B. Judis argues that, while Israelis and Palestinians must shoulder much of the blame, the United States has been the principal power outside the region since the end of World War II and as such must account for its repeated failed diplomacy efforts to resolve this enduring strife.</p><p>The fatal flaw in American policy, Judis shows, can be traced back to the Truman years. What happened between 1945 and 1949 sealed the fate of the Middle East for the remainder of the century. As a result, understanding that period holds the key to explaining almost everything that follows&#x2015;right down to George W. Bush's unsuccessful and ill-conceived effort to win peace through holding elections among the Palestinians, and Barack Obama's failed attempt to bring both parties to the negotiating table. A provocative narrative history animated by a strong analytical and moral perspective, and peopled by colorful and outsized personalities and politics, <i>Genesis</i> offers a fresh look at these critical postwar years, arguing that if we can understand how this stalemate originated, we will be better positioned to help end it.</p></p><p><b>John B.

You would have heard references to &#x201c;Palestine,&#x201d; but you wouldn&#x2019;t have found a nation with its own laws and government that corresponded to Palestine or Israel. The Turks, who ruled the region, divided the land into three parts for purposes of collecting taxes. The West Bank was part of the province of Syria; northern Palestine was part of the province of Beirut; and Jerusalem and its environs had their own district. <br>According to one estimate, the area corresponding to Palestine had about 340,000 people, of whom 300,000, or 88 percent, were Muslims or Druze, 27,000, or 8 percent, Christians, and 13,000, or 4 percent, Jews.1 Many of these Jews lived in Jerusalem, Nablus, and Hebron. A few were well-to-do descendants of Sephardic �migr�s from Spain, but many were more recent �migr�s from Europe who devoted themselves to religious study and prayer and survived off donations from abroad. <br>The Jews of Palestine suffered religious persecution, but no different from that inflicted on Christians in a society dominated by Muslims. For instance, both Jews and Christians were officially prohibited from building new houses of worship, but both groups were able to use bribes to get around the law. There was nothing like the wave of anti-Semitism that would sweep Europe during the late nineteenth century. &#x201c;Jews enjoyed a higher standing in Muslim society and enjoyed a greater affinity with the culture of their surroundings than the Jews in Eastern Europe,&#x201d; wrote the historian Yosef Gorny.2 <br>There was also little of a Western presence in the region. Americans were preoccupied with the Civil War and its aftermath. The great powers of Europe were just beginning to divide up Asia and Africa. The British had an interest in allying themselves with the Turks against the Russians, they were about to gain a foothold in Egypt, and they had begun to consider Palestine and its environs as a path eastward, but they had not done anything about it, and would not do so for the rest of the century. <br>There were rabbis and some notable Christians in Europe and the United States who thought the Jews should return to Palestine. The Christians were called &#x201c;restorationists,&#x201d; and in Britain they were able to attract support for their views among high officials who saw a Jewish Palestine in commercial or imperial terms. But most Jews accepted the Diaspora as an enduring condition. The Orthodox thought that the Jews would eventually return to Zion, but by a Messianic act of God rather than by an organized mass migration. Jews declared &#x201c;Next year in Jerusalem&#x201d; annually during Passover dinners, but few took these words literally. <br>Then, over the next forty years&#x2014;from the 1880s to the end of World War I and the early 1920s&#x2014;the region was utterly transformed. The Ottoman Empire was dissolved, a casualty of Turkey&#x2019;s alliance with Germany during World War I. Through a League of Nations mandate, Britain assumed control of Palestine, an area that initially included what became Transjordan and later Jordan, but it administered the two areas separately. As a result, the western part of the mandate, administered through Jerusalem, became known again as Palestine, the name the Romans had originally given the country, but that also had a more ancient root in the seafaring Philistines who were contemporaries of the Old Testament Jews. <br>By 1922, according to a British census, Palestine&#x2019;s population had grown to 752,048, of which Jews accounted for 83,900, or 11 percent. The sevenfold increase in the Jewish population had been spurred by the development of a Zionist movement in Europe, particularly in the Russian Pale of Settlement, which was in response to the simultaneous growth of nationalism and anti-Semitism in Central and Western Europe. Zionism was Jewish nationalism, but unlike German or Romanian nationalism, it was not centered on an existing homeland but on one that Jews had once inhabited and now wanted to return to. <br>The outward logic of Zionism was impeccable. The nations of Europe, where Jews had dwelt for hundreds of years, were treating them as a nation in their midst. Nationalist politicians and intellectuals in Central and Eastern Europe called for purging their countries of this alien nation. In response, Jews wanted a genuine nation of their own where they could be secure from persecution and oppression. The trouble came when Zionists specified where that nation should be. Two thousand years before, most Jews had lived in Palestine, and a few thousand still did. But other peoples had also inhabited Palestine over the millennia, and Arabs had lived there for 1,400 years. If Zionism&#x2019;s objective was to establish a Jewish state in Palestine, that meant ruling over or driving out the Arabs who already lived there. <br>In justifying their attempt to colonize Palestine, some Zionists&#x2014;who cited the influence of the Russian Zionist Ahad Ha&#x2019;am&#x2014;tried to come to terms with the Arab presence in Palestine. But many Zionists, following the example of Theodor Herzl, the Viennese author of <i>The Jewish State</i>, fell back on the same kind of rationalizations that the great powers had advanced in attempting to extend their reach over Asia and Africa, and that Christian Europe, and that Christian restorationists, and even before them, the Crusaders, had used to justify the conquest of Palestine. They promised to reclaim Palestine for the religion of the Bible, to civilize the Arabs, and to revive the land that, they claimed, the Arabs had allowed to become a desolate wasteland. Most American Zionist leaders would trace their lineage back to Herzl rather than to Ahad Ha&#x2019;am and would adopt a distorted understanding of Palestine and its Arab inhabitants. <br> <i>Anti-Semitism and Zionism</i> <br>The idea of a Jewish return to Zion (which originally referred to Jerusalem) goes back to the Babylonian captivity in the sixth century B.C.E. and was promoted over the centuries by a succession of Jewish rabbis and mystics. The English Puritans, including those who settled in New England, believed on biblical grounds in a Jewish return to the region of Palestine. Napoleon advocated a Jewish state during his eastern campaign in 1799. And in the early nineteenth century, British officials, led by the Christian revivalist Lord Shaftesbury, called on Britain to promote a Jewish return to the Holy Land. <br>By midcentury, there was some stirring among Jewish intellectuals. In the 1860s, the German Socialist Moses Hess, a former comrade of Karl Marx, and the Polish rabbi Zvi Hirsch Kalischer, both of whom were deeply impressed by the Italian movement for national unification, Il Risorgimento, advocated the gradual creation of a Jewish state. But the birth of a Zionist movement&#x2014;and the beginning of emigration&#x2014;had to wait until the 1880s, till the outbreak of anti-Semitism in Russia and Eastern Europe and its spread westward. This turned Jewish Zionism from a religious fantasy into a political movement. <br>Jews, of course, had suffered persecution for centuries, but much though not all of it was based on their beliefs and what they were reputed to have done to Jesus Christ. It was religious persecution. By contrast, nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century anti-Semitism was primarily a toxic blend of nationalism, racism, and imperialism directed at Jews as an alien national group within nations or empires rather than as a religious group among other religions. It coincided with the rise throughout Europe of the unified nation state and of national rebellions against empires. <br>In the nineteenth century, Italians and Hungarians sought to free themselves from the Austro-Hungarian Empire; Romanians and other Balkan peoples from the Ottoman Empire; the Poles from the Russian Empire; and Germans from the Hapsburgs and from the legacy of defeat in the Napoleonic wars. They defined their national aspirations along ethnic and quasi-racial lines that led them to see Jews as an alien nation. Johann Gottlieb Fichte, a father of German nationalism, described Germans as a race that nature &#x201c;joined to each other in a multitude of invisible bonds&#x201d; and Jews as &#x201c;a state within a state.&#x201d; Fichte infamously declared that he could only imagine granting civil rights to Jews if one were &#x201c;to cut off all their heads in one night, and to set new ones on their shoulders, which should contain not a single Jewish idea.&#x201d;3 <br>In Austria and Russia, defenders of the empire invoked their own brand of nationalism against the secessionists and against Jews, whom they blamed for the unrest. In Austria, George Ritter von Sch�nerer built a pan-German movement based on the premise that Austria had to rid itself of Jewish influence.4 In Russia, the Black Hundreds swore loyalty to the czar and Russian absolutism while leading violent assaults against Jews. <br>This fusion of religious intolerance, national chauvinism, and what the Russian Zionist Leo Pinsker called &#x201c;demonopathy&#x201d; inspired new laws threatening Jews&#x2019; livelihood and led to a succession of violent pogroms in Russia and the Russian Pale of Settlement&#x2014;the western edge of the Russian empire to which the czarist regime restricted Jews. In the spring of 1881, massive anti-Jewish riots took place in response to false rumors that the Jews had assassinated Alexander II. These riots, in which Jews were killed and homes and synagogues destroyed, spread to 160 cities and villages in the Pale and recurred over the next four decades. The American ambassador wrote, &#x201c;The acts which have been committed are more worthy of the Dark Ages than of the present century.&#x201d;5 <br>In Eastern and Southern Europe, nationalist movements, seeking to throw off Austrian or Turkish rule, turned violently against the Jews. In Central and Western Europe, where Jews were no longer confined to ghettos, anti-Semitic movements and parties, typified by Karl Lueger&#x2019;s Austrian Christian Social party and Adolf Stoecker&#x2019;s party of the same name in Germany, directed their ire at the least and most successful Jews. They stirred fear that poverty-stricken Jewish immigrants from Russia and Eastern Europe were creating new ghettos while at the same time they excoriated wealthy, successful Jews who had lived in Germany and Austria for generations and who were assuming high positions in the professions, government, and the media. These parties called for restricting immigration and setting quotas for Jews in professions and universities. In France, an upsurge in anti-Semitism in the 1880s and &#x2019;90s culminated in the frame-up, trial, and conviction of the Jewish army captain Alfred Dreyfus for treason. <br>By stigmatizing Jews as an alien nation rather than as a religious group, the new anti-Semitism inspired Jews to consider whether, if they were a national group, they needed a land-based nation of their own. And the pogroms lent urgency to the task. While the first great Zionist tract, Hess&#x2019;s <i>Rome and Jerusalem</i>, was ignored during his lifetime, the Russian Zionists of the 1880s, writing in the wake of the pogroms, were able to parlay their readership into an organized following. <br>The first two prominent Russian Zionists, Moshe Leib Lilienblum and Leo Pinsker, became Zionists in the wake of the pogroms. Lilienblum was a Talmudic scholar who, after breaking with the rabbinical orthodoxy, fled to Odessa, the capital of Jewish modernism. Pinsker was born in Russian Poland, the son of a distinguished Hebrew scholar. He was trained as a physician at the University of Moscow. He practiced in Odessa and was honored by Czar Nicholas I for his treatment of soldiers during the Crimean War. <br>Pinsker initially advocated Jewish assimilation, or &#x201c;Russification&#x201d; through the use of the Russian language and education in Russian culture. He was a leading member of the Society for the Spread of Culture among the Jews of Russia. But the pogroms turned him to Zionism. He resigned from the Society for the Spread of Culture and in 1882 published <i>Auto-Emancipation</i>, which helped inspire the Zionist movement in Russia. According to Pinsker, the Jews&#x2019; problem was that &#x201c;among the nations under which they dwell,&#x201d; they were the &#x201c;ghost&#x201d; of a nation rather than a real nation. Even after leaving Palestine, &#x201c;they lived on spiritually as a nation,&#x201d; but &#x201c;they lack a certain distinctive national character, inherent in all other nations, which is formed by common residence in a single state.&#x201d;6 That accounted for what Pinsker called &#x201c;Judeophobia.&#x201d; &#x201c;If the fear of ghosts is something inborn, and has a certain justification in the psychic life of mankind,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;why be surprised as the effect produced by this dead but still living nation.&#x201d;7 <br>Pinsker was convinced that Judeophobia was unavoidable as long as Jews were scattered as foreign bodies in the midst of other nations. &#x201c;As a psychic aberration it is hereditary,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;and as a disease transmitted for two thousand years, it is incurable.&#x201d; Lilienblum, writing in 1883, was similarly pessimistic: &#x201c;Civilization, which could virtually deliver us from those persecutions which have a religious basis, can do nothing at all for us against those persecutions that have a nationalistic basis.&#x201d;8 <br>Pinsker&#x2019;s solution was not to fight Judeophobia. &#x201c;We must give up contending against these hostile impulses as we must against every other inherited predisposition,&#x201d; he wrote.9 Instead, Jews must eliminate the ghosts by establishing a real nation of their own. &#x201c;Grant us our independence, allow us to take care of ourselves, give us but a little strip of land like that of the Serbians and Romanians, give us a chance to lead a national existence and then prate about our lacking manly virtues.&#x201d;10 <br>Pinsker thought that Palestine was the likely site of a Jewish state, but he didn&#x2019;t claim Jewish title on biblical grounds. &#x201c;The goal of our present endeavors must be not the &#x2018;Holy Land,&#x2019; but a land of our own,&#x201d; he wrote.11 Lilienblum was more willing to evoke past ownership. &#x201c;Why should we be strangers in Gentile countries,&#x201d; he asked, &#x201c;while the land of our fathers has not yet disappeared from the face of the earth, is still desolate, and can, along with its neighboring environs, incorporate our people?&#x201d;12 <br>Lilienblum&#x2019;s question, which was really an assertion, lay at the heart of early arguments for Zionism. While a few secular Jews like Pinsker eschewed biblical claims to Palestine, most Zionists did not&#x2014;and that included secular Zionists like the young Pole David Ben-Gurion. Zionists regarded Palestine as the Jews&#x2019; home from which they had been unjustly expelled by the Romans in the first and second centuries C.E., and to which they were fully entitled to return and to lay claim as their own. <br>This conception of Zionism, rooted in the Old Testament, rested on a mythic version of Palestine. In fact, the land from &#x201c;Dan to Beersheba&#x201d; that the Jews briefly ruled was home to many different peoples and tribes.13 The area was also a &#x201c;land of passage&#x201d; in the Middle East through which different peoples entered and left&#x2014;some voluntarily, some forcibly. In historical terms, the Zionist claim to Palestine had no more validity than the claim by some radical Islamists to a new caliphate. Nevertheless, this argument for Zionism, based on the Old Testament, carried great weight. <br>It was reinforced by Christian Zionism and its conception of Palestine as a &#x201c;holy land&#x201d; that had been despoiled by Islamic infidels. That idea went back to the Crusades, but it had been reshaped by the Christian Restorationists in the nineteenth century who called for a Jewish return to Palestine.

George Gregory began his career as a guard for the Federal Bureau of Prisons in 1940. Following his training, he was sent to the federal prison at Sandstone, Minnesota. A few years later he enlisted in the Marine Corps. Badly wounded at Iwo Jima, he returned to Sandstone after a long rehabilitation. When the Bureau of Prisons closed Sandstone in 1947, Gregory was transferred to Alcatraz, which had been a federal penitentiary since 1934.<br> For the next fifteen years, Gregory worked on &#x201c;The Rock.&#x201d; He takes the reader along on a correctional officer&#x2019;s tour of duty, showing what it was like to pull a lonely, tedious night of sentry duty in the Road Tower, or witness illicit transactions in the clothing room, or forcibly quell a riot in the cell blocks. Gregory provides an insider&#x2019;s account of the tenures of all four of Alcatraz&#x2019;s wardens and their sometimes contradictory approaches to administering the institution. He knew and regularly interacted with such legendary inmates as Robert Stroud (the Birdman of Alcatraz) and George &#x201c;Machine Gun&#x201d; Kelly.<br> Without glamorizing or demonizing either the staff or the convicts, <i>Alcatraz Screw </i>provides a candid portrayal of corruption, drug abuse, and sexual practices, as well as efforts at reform and unrecorded acts of kindness. Various incidents in the memoir convey the fear, hatred, frustration, boredom, and unavoidable tension of being incarcerated. With the inclusion of maps and diagrams of Alcatraz Island, as well as photographs of inmates, officers, and the prison itself, this book offers insight into life at the notorious Alcatraz from an unprecedented perspective.</p><p><b>George H. Gregory</b> was a correctional officer at the U.S. Penitentiary at Alcatraz from 1947 to 1962.There has been a resurgence of interest in Alcatraz. In The Great Escape (2001), Jolene Babyak gives her version of the only successful escape from the Rock, and in Alcatraz Justice (2002), Earnest Lageson rehashes a long-forgotten trail of three inmates involved in a hostage situation. Now, Gregory, a former prison guard, has written his memoir of 15 years at Alcatraz. Given his background as a marine in World War II, it is no surprise that Gregory was a hard-nosed officer who stressed his ability to keep a dangerous population in line. Yet he also includes in the memoir some priceless prison vignettes. For example, he describes a fracas in the yard between a young officer and some seasoned cons, a confrontation between a doctor and his patients, and the poignant story of a mentally deranged inmate whom he saved from the abuse of the other officers. Although Alcatraz was unique because of its remote location, readers may be surprised to learn that the conditions at the prison, and the characteristics of its inmates, were not so different from those that exist today. For comparison, try Ted Conover's Newjack (2001), the memoirs of an officer in Sing Sing Correctional Facility in the 21st century. Alcatraz Screw will probably not appeal to the general reader, but it will certainly appeal to readers interested in prison life and those who have a special interest in Alcatraz.

In 1959 his father, after spending a year as a political prisoner in President Sukarno's jails, fled Indonesia with his family. Between 1959 and 1964 the Lee family traveled throughout Hong Kong, Macau and Japan, until arriving in America.<br><br>Li-Young Lee's first poetry collection, Rose, won the New York University's 1986 Delmore Schwartz Memorial Poetry Award. His second collection, The City In Which I Love You, was the 1990 Lamont Poetry Selection of the Academy of American Poets. His third collection, Book of My Nights, was awarded the 2002 William Carlos Williams Award from the Poetry Society of America.<br><br>In September 2006, BOA Editions published Breaking the Alabaster Jar: Conversations with Li-Young Lee, edited by Earl G. Ingersoll. This book collects the best dozen interviews Li-Young Lee has granted since the 1986 publication of Rose, including the 1988 interview with Bill Moyers on his The Power of the Word series. Breaking the Alabaster Jar contains new insights on Li-Young Lee's aesthetics, history, and various philosophies. Breaking the Alabaster Jar is an invaluable companion to Li-Young Lee's previous award-winning poetry collections.<br><br>Li-Young Lee currently lives in Chicago, Illinois, with his wife Donna and their two children.<br>assionate and profound, Lee's long-awaited third collection charts the mid-life ontological crisis of a speaker who "can't tell what my father said about the sea... from the sea itself," and finds himself unmoored without that strong male voice. Lee's father was a personal physician to Mao Zedong, who took the family to Jakarta (where Lee was born) in the '50s. As Indonesia began persecuting Chinese citizens and his father was imprisoned, Lee's family left the country, spent five years moving from place to place in Asia, and arrived in the U.S. in 1964. (These events are described in The Winged Seed, Lee's American Book Award-winning memoir of 1995.) Lee has ever been concerned with questions of origins, but in the 11 years since the publication of his last collection, memories of childhood answers furnished by father, mother and siblings now fail to assuage the poet's 3 a.m. doubts. Yet he does not trust himself to formulate answers on his own in these 35 nocturnes, and the father seems to be missing or dead. The poet's tightly wrought, extraordinarily careful and finally heart-wrenching responses finally boil down to one ultimate cry: "Where is his father? Who is his mother?" The complex permutations of these fundamental inquiries and their unsatisfactory answers construct a space in which knowledge and redemption, if never quite attained, always seem possible. Lee is never faced with sheer emptiness; his "silence thunders," a vocal presence to which Lee's speaker responds, "declaring a new circumference/ even the stars enlarge by crowding down to hear." (Sept. 15) Forecast: A favorite on course syllabi, Lee should sell strongly and steadily with this long-awaited new collection. The Winged Seed, first published by S&amp;S, is available in paperback from Ruminator Books, the Minnesota house (and review) formerly called Hungry Mind.<p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Sherlock: The Mind Palace: A Coloring Book Adventure</h2><p><p>The first official coloring book from the hit BBC series, filled with more than fifty intricate scenes and cast images from the show</p><p><em>The game is on . . .</em></p><p><em>Sherlock: The Mind Palace</em> is a unique celebration of the rich visual landscape of the BBC series <em>Sherlock</em>, featuring more than fifty intricate pieces of artwork by artist Mike Collins.

She has won many awards for her writing, including the Governor General&#39;s Award and the Ruth Schwartz Award for Awake and Dreaming.Grade 5-8 An important summer in the life of 12-year-old Patricia Potter involves a trip back in time for her to observe her mother, Ruth, in her mother's twelfth year. While her parents, both successful career people in Toronto, work out a separation, Patricia is sent off to her aunt's lake cottage in Alberta. Raised by fashionable and undemonstrative parents, Patricia feels out of place in the company of her rough-and-tumble cousins. Her escape comes when she discovers an old watch engraved to her grandmother, Patricia. When she winds up the watch she becomes an invisible observer to the happenings that took place in her mother's family 35 years ago. Patricia goes back and forth in time, observing her mother's unhappy childhood, and she decides to give her mother another chance, knowing what she does about the past. Although the novel is about two generations of mother-daughter relationships, all readers see of the grown-up mothers, Ruth and Nan, is from the perspective of a child. Hence, both appear as wooden and flat characters. Although the watch device is a handy one to allow the girl a glimpse of the past, there is not much explanation as to how or why the watch possesses this power. Science fiction fans may be disappointed, but the book will show adolescents how relationships in the present are often locked into patterns of the past, and that a discovery of one's family often reveals much about oneself.

And now, as he sat in the children&#x2019;s playroom, he reached for a crayon and a leaf of construction paper with the gravity of an architect, his smooth, creamed-coffee face immobile, a single mole dotting his cheek. He stared down at the paper through two dark, luminous eyes, in which the sharp and bright edges of things flashed in reflection. He blocked out the mosaic of murals on the walls, the stacks of glossy unopened books, the piles of blocks, and the blank-faced children, each lost in an opaque realm of secret activity.<br> <br>The gleam from the track lighting glazed everything in the room as if it had all been brushed by a baker&#x2019;s egg white. There was the smell of lemon disinfectant, which he did not like, which hung always in the air like a toxic cloud. There was the flicker from the farthest bulb at the ceiling that caught his eye again, as it had for several weeks, a distracting affront to the even order of light. But Sephiri turned his mind away from all of that now. There was only the sheet of white, the crayon in his hand, the images in his head. He&#x2019;d had dreams before in his seven years on the earth, terrible visions from the Land of Air. There were the shadows that peeled themselves from the walls in his room and chased him out of his bed. There was the red creature that hid inside his mattress, the impish thing that cut through the springs, its incandescent eyes staring up at him through a dark, gaping hole.<br> <br>Those dreams were not like the loveliness of his World of Water, the realm of deep blue and luminescence where Sephiri spent much of his time floating. He loved to drift far out to the Obsidians, as his sea friends called them. They were the tips of submerged mountains, enormous peaks that rose from the water like black pyramids from the deep. They marked where the invertebrates and the spiked beasts and the water plants ruled. Sephiri loved them all. He could speak there and be understood. The creatures living there gave him assurance that all he witnessed and heard in that place was real.<br> <br>He wasn&#x2019;t sure about the creatures flying through his dreams. They weren&#x2019;t anything like the creatures of the Land of Air. The caterpillars he&#x2019;d squeezed between his fingers in the backyard. The flies on the glass rim of his orange juice. The spiders that hung in corners. They were not like the other things he was able to keep a photograph of in his mind after one look: the number of tiles on a floor, the license plates of cars along their street, the label of ingredients of everything in the medicine cabinet. His mother locked the cabinet, but Sephiri was able to get it open anyway. He adored the Tylenol and cold medication boxes and containers, which he would line up and then line up again. There were lists of active and inactive ingredients, with marvelous arrangements of letters, which he had memorized without understanding how to pronounce any of them: acetaminophen, dextromethorphan, phenylephrine, anhydrous citric acid, potassium sorbate. He loved the sodiums madly: sodium borate, sodium chloride, sodium laurel, sodium laureth, sodium bicarbonate, sodium benzoate, sodium citrate.<br> <br>When he was finished with the ingredients, he would focus on the letters that spelled WARNING on each container. He recognized this word from the order of the letters and knew it was the same word on the big sign above the red emergency door at the Takoma Park Autism Center, where he spent nearly every day. There were other things written next to WARNING on the boxes. He didn&#x2019;t know what any of those words meant, but he was sure they were trying to save him from tasting something disgusting. Sephiri thought the words, especially in this case, probably referred to various kinds of foods he hated. Say, squash or chicken, for example. Or nasty sandwiches, which he was sure had to be any sandwich that was not peanut butter and jelly.<br> <br>He had gotten off the safety cap and swallowed some pretty blue pills once and had to be rushed to the hospital, screaming. There were maddening lights, sounds, and touching. There were white sheets that chafed his skin and cold, shiny things. Worst of all, there were no bathtubs anywhere&#x2014;no porcelain baths filled with blue water, where he could calm down, where he could get away, out to the three mountaintops that rose from the ocean. <br> <br>The beings&#x2014;terrifying tangle of fingers and voices&#x2014;had put him in the shower instead. He&#x2019;d acted out his fury and fits with his eyes clamped shut but had to take a shower anyway. More than losing his voice from the screaming, more than the stuff they did when he was finally finished vomiting and had been cleaned with that dreadful soap that smelled like the bottle in the cabinet that read POLISH REMOVER, Sephiri was furious that he hadn&#x2019;t had a chance to finish ensuring order in the medicine cabinet. He hadn&#x2019;t had the chance to finish saving the Tylenol boxes from disarray, from their disconnection to their places on the earth.<br> <br>After the blue pills, and only after his mother fell asleep, he would slip out of bed to open the cabinet, to order and reorder. He promised the boxes and bottles that he would never swallow anything from them again. He had hurt their feelings without realizing it. He had learned his lesson. He would put everything back as it had been, with each item turned at the exact angle of origination, with the pill packs arranged as they were and the lock clicked back in place. And he would get up every night to sanctify what was behind that mirror in the bathroom over the sink, with the distant sound of a freight train&#x2019;s midnight whistle as his cue. Such activity was a deep balm to Sephiri, a way to make everything in the world fit in its precise position on the planet. As all things should. Not the jungle of confusion he was forced to witness, to waddle in, every day of his life.<br> <br>But there had been nothing like these flying creatures, these wild things that had somehow found him in his head. And for many days and nights, they swarmed the hinterlands of his mind, riding his thoughts, replacing the shadows and the mattress thing, replacing even the medicine cabinet lately. The glowing amber in their bellies was warm and everlasting. That much he knew. They reminded Sephiri of the oily liquid inside his mother&#x2019;s dusty perfume bottles, which he had spent considerable time ordering in the twilight of dawn when the house was still and asleep, when there was less interference from all the other things assaulting his eyes and ears. And every time Sephiri thought of the locusts, he wanted to smile; it was something his mother had often tried to get him to do, something he&#x2019;d seen demonstrated on the faces of others but had never understood how it worked.<br> <br>Smiles intrigued him. He spent many days thinking about them, especially at bathtime, when his mother often smiled at him in the quiet. He would scream to let her know that he did not want to be soaped up right away, that he had an important visit to make to the Obsidians, where he might ask the Great Octopus about smiles and other things he did not understand. He flailed and splashed. He knocked the soap from her hands and kicked up enough water to pool on the bathroom floor. Then he would hear the loudness, the oncoming train in her voice. &#x201c;Stop it stop it stop it stop it stop it.&#x201d; She hissed and held on. He persisted. He hadn&#x2019;t had the time to stop it stop it right then. He had to get into his boat before the water got cold, before the tub stopper was pulled out and the tributaries were drained.<br> <br>When at last his mother seemed to understand his signals, when she was as soaked and outraged from all the splashing as if she had been dropped into a circus dumping tank, she left him alone to calm down, to absorb the turquoise and warmth, to disembark. It was at frustrating moments such as this that Sephiri wished that they spoke the same language. But he did not speak the language of Air, the land of his mother. He did not understand how things were done there or what occupied the species. There were different sounds and faces that somehow ruled them, and these were attached to meaning that was unintelligible to him. He had no patience for the stops and starts that fell from their mouths. There was no sharing of thought and feeling as there was with his friends of the deep. Sometimes, though, when his mother tired of chasing him, when he tired of screaming, she held him, and he allowed himself to be held. They felt each other. That was as close as Sephiri had ever gotten to reaching his mother and penetrating the Land of Air.<br> <br>He had discovered as early as two years old that Air and Water were different places with different ways and language. He had been playing with some colored blocks on the floor. He had wanted to line the blocks up and then line them up again. He remembered his mother picking up different blocks, saying something, and pointing. He did not look at her face, but he could see that finger pointing from the corner of his eye and her hand holding the block. She took his hand and placed it on each block, and he felt as if he was being pulled apart. He didn&#x2019;t want to hold the blocks. He didn&#x2019;t want to think about their shape and color and mimic her sounds. He had wanted only to line them up and line them up again. To ensure that they were where they were supposed to be. He tried to explain. But his mother did not comprehend him, and the more he tried to get her to understand, the more it became clear to him that she would never know his language.<br> <br>Sephiri gripped the crayon and looked down at the paper, thinking instead of the fat-bellied locusts of his dreams again, for he did not want to dwell on things that would make him cry. Why had the locusts come? In his dreams, he saw them growing to bursting, pushing up and out of the earth, taking flight. Above his head, they were waiting, rising, and hovering, as if by their gathering they anticipated something. He began guiding the crayon, his hand moving effortlessly. He first drew the foreground and then sketched a vast plain. In the center, he constructed two towers with a giant iron gate connecting them and an enormous structure behind them. Sephiri didn&#x2019;t know what it was, but it reminded him of the coat closet he locked himself into sometimes at home, but bigger. A giant black box that held things, with a voice that called to him from its farthest corner.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come here&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>He did not recognize the voice, and he was not sure what the two words meant. Especially together. He&#x2019;d heard them said before at the Autism Center, and sometimes, he thought, his mother said them too. But he couldn&#x2019;t decide if the two words were the same as other phrases he&#x2019;d heard: &#x201c;come home&#x201d; or &#x201c;can hear.&#x201d; But all that was too much to figure out now, since the other things were so clear to him at last. His hand moved deftly, sketching enormous mountains in the background, a cloud of locusts flying over their peaks.<br> <br>Sephiri furiously continued drawing, and at the height of his fever, he snapped his crayon. He threw the drawing down and watched the paper slide under the table. He was angry that his hand had not been able to keep up with his mind, one of many things that frustrated him about being in the Land of Air. He couldn&#x2019;t stand the different regimens and schedules that were not of his own making, how the people were always telling and talking and asking, until it all became a sort of noise that ran together in his head. This place was filled with air, not water, where he felt at home.<br> <br>He could float out to the realness of his World of Water, where the sea was an endless expanse as turquoise as the liquid in his �bathtub. Where he didn&#x2019;t have to try to understand the strange sounds of words dripping from mouths. He could head to his �desired destination anytime he wanted, with only his little wooden boat gliding toward the three great black rocks that rose from the ocean. The dolphin waited for his company there, and the Great Octopus sat in majesty in his iridescent lair on the ocean floor. What concerned him in Air did not concern him in Water. He did not need the laws of physics to rein in his terrors, frustrations, and confusions there. He did not need to spin or bang or rock or flap. He could forget about the creatures flying in his dreams, the voice in the giant black box, the meaning of sounds and faces and smiles.

He first came to international prominence in 1979, when he was recruited from the cult metal band Quiet Riot to play with Ozzy Osbourne, who had been fired from Black Sabbath for his drink and drug addictions and was in urgent need of a co-writer to kickstart a solo career. How and why Ozzy and Randy went on to find enormous success is one of the key themes of Crazy Train, named after the first and most famous Osbourne/Rhoads co-composition. It was Randy's pioneering combination of neo-classical soloing, catchy riffage and unforgettable songwriting which propelled Ozzy. The two albums that Randy recorded with Quiet Riot and the two with Ozzy showcase the young guitarist's immense ability, although the full extent of his talent may never have been revealed. In 1982 he died in an air crash. The parallels between Crazy Train and the author's best-selling To Live Is To Die: The Life And Death Of Metallica's Cliff Burton (Jawbone 2009) are intentional and obvious. Both books deal with a musical prodigy who died tragically in his mid-20s; both men have a vast following and a profile which has risen in the years since their deaths; and both men have a large coterie of friends, family and associates prepared to tell their stories for the very first time.</p></p><p><p><b>Joel McIver</b> is the bestselling author of <i>Justice for All: The Truth About Metallica,</i> which has been translated into 9 languages, and several other books.

This ossuary is the first ever archaeological discovery directly confirming the existence of Jesus, and his relationship to his father, Joseph, and brother, James, who became the leader of the important Jewish Christian community in Jerusalem. No one is as qualified and well connected to recount the discovery and its authentication as Hershel Shanks, whose magazine first broke the story. </p><p> "A scientific detetective story with extremely high religious stakes."</p><p> &#x2013; <em>Time</em></p><p> </p></p><p>Before lay readers can grasp the significance of this book, they&#x2019;ll need a little historical reference. In the time of Jesus, the Jews of Jerusalem often buried their dead in tombs. After a year, when the flesh had disintegrated, it was customary to gather the bones and place them in a small limestone chest called an ossuary. Sometimes the name of the deceased would be inscribed onto the outside of the box. Flash forward to the spring of 2002 when Andre Lemaire, a specialist in ancient texts, was asked to read the Aramaic inscription on an ossuary that was owned by a collector in Israel. When Lemaire translated the inscription--"James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus"--he knew he had just stumbled upon an artifact in the same caliber as the lost Ark of the Covenant. <p></p><p> Just as this artifact is now in safe hands, so is the amazing story of its discovery. Co-authors Hershel Shanks (<i>The Mystery and Meaning of the Dead Sea Scrolls</i>) and Ben Witherington III (<i>The Jesus Quest</i>) are esteemed scholars as well as riveting storytellers. They expertly recount the exciting moments of discovery and the darker moments of despair (at one point the ossuary is improperly shipped and breaks into five pieces). They build a convincing case against its forgery and offer a flourishing finish in which they delve into the life of James, who was a linking force between the Jews and Christian of the first millennium, and could possibly continue that role into the second millennium. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>Hershel Shanks is the premier figure in communicating, through his magazines, books, and conferences, the world of biblical archaeology to general readers.

After Buchwald goes to the Capawock Theater on Martha's Vineyard to see Paramount's new Eddie Murphy comedy (about an African king who comes to the States, finds a wife in Queens, and takes her back home to marry), he arms his sling with stones and goes looking for Paramount. The story, in part, is taken from a treatment Buchwald sold to Paramount, which then spent over a half million on scripts (the first being by Bernheim) for this Murphy vehicle. Aside from cash, Buchwald-Bernheim were offered points in the picture's net profits, should it be made and there be such profits. Then the top execs who bought Buchwald's story and put it into development moved to other companies and the Buchwald/Bernheim script was dropped. The authors resold it, to Warner Brothers, but then Paramount announced Coming to America and Warner dropped its flick as too similar to the new Murphy vehicle. Enter O'Donnell (writing here with Los Angeles Times entertainment reporter McDougal), whose legal firm breaks a rule and takes the case on contingency. Paramount and its legal team deny any theft of Buchwald's ideas but then find themselves defending Hollywood's net-profits clause, which allows a studio to deduct its overall losses from its hits' earnings. Huge stars get points in gross profits, but, through creative accounting, small-time creators are denied rewards, despite a film's massive returns. Here, the case's legal stages are spellbinding and not excessively detailed. Don't miss Buchwald's drolleries to the servile Writers Guild of America or Eddie Murphy's toothy two-day deposition, though he's a no-show at the clause-busting trial. You'll never eat net profits in these contracts again. (B&amp;w photographs--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>One of 1988's biggest movie hits was Coming to America , which starred Eddie Murphy. One of Hollywood's biggest lawsuits ever soon ensued when humorist Art Buchwald and his partner, Alain Bernheim, sued Paramount, claiming that they had actually created the story upon which the movie was based. O'Donnell, their attorney, and McDougal, a Los Angeles Times investigative reporter, have turned this legal battle into a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at how Hollywood really works and how major litigation really takes place. Detailing the dispute from the very beginning to the very bitter end, the authors show how legal strategies evolved (e.g., why the plaintiffs sued for breach of contract, not plagiarism) and the courtroom machinations that culminated in a trial to determine how a blockbuster movie could somehow fail to turn any profit, according to the studio. The strongest depictions, however, are of the cast of characters--sympathetic plaintiffs, overworked attorneys, witnesses both helpful and otherwise, and studio executives who were often either devious or greedy, if not both. Very highly recommended for all collections. (Photos not seen).<br><i>- Sally G.

"Zima Blue" is about an artist who works in a color named for him and has progressed from small to star-sized installations; it concludes with the final piece of his career and reveals his mysterious past; the story's animating idea is the common-enough concept of a robot that has far surpassed its original role, but Reynolds takes it to greater lengths and handles it with especial style. "Beyond the Aquila Rift" is one of those stories about the hazards of interstellar travel, especially when using technology that isn't entirely reliable, and a particularly interesting example of the kind it is. One tale doesn't trade in the far future but instead revolves around a man whose wife has just died and his brief interaction with her doppelganger in a parallel universe; it is touching and sweet, ideally balancing technology and character development. "Spirey and the Queen" started as part of Reynolds' Revelation Space universe but became something quite different, involving an ancient war and strange machine intelligences. Reynolds does short stories with particular flair, and this collection contains some spectacular sf storytelling. <i>Regina Schroeder</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

They were quickly reminded by their parents that Grandpa was very old and very wealthy and it was in their best interests to call their grandfather whatever he wished to be called.<br>Corey recalled few things about these Sunday rituals except that he didn't like the food, his cousins, or sitting at the dinner table and listening to the same inspirational speech his grandfather insisted on delivering before dessert was served. It seemed like the chocolate cake and vanilla ice cream were given as payment for sitting through the tedious, seven-and-one-half-minute lecture.<br>When he was eight, to fight boredom, Corey started timing the speech with the stopwatch his grandfather had given him for Christmas. The speech at its shortest was seven minutes and thirty seconds. Each week, Corey would try to guess just how many seconds under or over it would be. As the years went on, the speech took longer and longer to deliver. By the time Corey was fifteen, the speech ran close to nine minutes. Corey knew the speech backward and forward and had once recited it backward to his shocked and furious parents. They withheld his allowance for two weeks and forbade him to do it again. "Ever! Anywhere!"<br>Corey had learned early on that his grandfather was a multi-multimillionaire and that all his relatives, including his father, were after his money. On the Sundays when they visited the old man, his father would insist that his mother wear her most attractive clothes.<br>"Cynthia, darling," he remembered his father saying, "why don't you wear your darker lipstick, it enhances your smile."<br>When Paul Carter had asked Mr. Hammersberg for the hand of his youngest daughter, Cynthia, he had received permission and an admonition. "I will know by the bloom on my daughter's cheeks and the smile on her lips just how loving and caring a husband you are."<br>From that day forward, Paul was careful not to do anything that would keep his wife's lips from smiling or her cheeks from blooming. It was fortunate he liked her well enough so that being a good and thoughtful husband was not too much of a burden.<br>At his eighty-fifth birthday party, Hampa Ham, who had not delivered his famed "Hammersberg Address" for five years, decided once again to bore his loyal family, but with a slower, muted version.<br>Corey, who could still recite it backward, found himself paying rapt attention. The speech, because of the old man's infirmities, timed out at nineteen minutes, but the salient points were all there.<br>"Know what you want and go after it!"<br>"Timidity will get you nowhere."<br>"People who are afraid to ask questions are people who live in the dark."<br>"If there is someone who has something you want, ask him how he got it . . . and then go out and do what he did!"<br>When the old man promised that it was the last time he would make his Sunday speech, he was met by a chorus of insincere voices urging him to reconsider and assuring him that he would live forever. While the sycophantic din was at its apex, Corey asked his Hampa Ham if he might have a few moments alone with him.<br>His parents and relatives watched Corey and his grandfather sitting out on the veranda. The two seemed to be having a good visit. No one could hear what was being said, but the amount of laughter Corey provoked and the manner in which the two shook hands and embraced was quite disturbing to all the heirs and heiresses.<br>Hampa Ham passed away the following Sunday.<br>The reading of the will was held in the library of the Holly Hills mansion. Most of Charles Hammersberg's blood relatives were openly angry at what they learned. One nephew's face turned beet-red as he sounded off at the grievous injustice he had been done by that "selfish old bastard who bored us to shit every Sunday preaching that damned sermon."<br>Cynthia Carter was saddened by her father's death, but quite pleased at her son's extreme good fortune. She did wonder why her father had chosen to award Corey ten million dollars when she was bequeathed but five million and her husband only a hundred thousand and an old Packard touring car. In the quiet of their bedroom, Paul insisted that it was they who were responsible for their son's windfall inheritance. It was they who had taught him his good manners and courteous behavior. Cynthia suggested that perhaps Corey himself had played a part in winning the huge inheritance. She reminded Paul of how their son had utterly endeared himself to her father when he had mangled the pronunciation of his name.<br>"Nobody in the history of the universe ever gave a person ten million dollars for accidentally inventing a silly nickname like Hampa Ham," Paul argued. "It was the upbringing that did it!"<br>In fact, it was neither the painstaking parenting nor the cute baby talk that had tilted the scales in Corey's favor. It was the admissions he had made to his grandfather on that fateful last Sunday. He had admitted to his Hampa Ham how, when he was young, he had dreaded coming to the Sunday dinners knowing that he would have to suffer through a boring lecture before getting his cake and ice cream. </p></p><h2>Birds of India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and the Maldives</h2><p><p>From the snowcapped Himalayas and the Indus valley, to the Ganges delta and the Sri Lankan forests, the Indian subcontinent is home to 13% of the world's species of birds and thousands of birders and ecotourists flock to the area every year.

John MacGregor draws on his dual training in art history and in psychiatry and psychoanalysis to describe not only this evolution in attitudes but also the significant influence of the art of the mentally ill on the development of modern art as a whole. His detailed narrative, with its strangely beautiful illustrations, introduces us to a fascinating group of people that includes the psychotic artists, both trained and untrained, and the psychiatrists, psychoanalysts, critics, and art historians who encountered their work.</p><br></p><p>By tracing its change from a curiosity to an area of study for both creative artists and psychiatrists, MacGregor explores the art of the insane as a key to intellectual and cultural history from the 18th to the mid-20th centuries. The "discovery" of this art, says MacGregor, was made possible by the application of psychiatry's scientific methods to the realm of creativity. Careful documentation and preservation of work by psychopathic artists led to the recognition that their art, like the - correction: The publication date for Nan cy Chodorow's Feminism and Psychoana lytic Theory , reviewed in LJ 10/1/89, has been changed from November 1989 to Janu ary 1990. work of other artists, expresses a world view that cannot be separated from its social background. MacGregor also details the interest in and influence of psychopathic art on important 20th-century figures (e.g., Klee, Dali, Dubuffet).

Marshall, chief of staff of the U.S. Army during World War II, faced the daunting task not only of overseeing two theaters of a global conflict but also of selecting the best generals to carry out American grand strategy. <i>Marshall and His Generals</i> is the first and only book to focus entirely on that selection process and the performances, both stellar and disappointing, that followed from it. Stephen Taaffe chronicles and critiques the background, character, achievements, and failures of the more than three dozen general officers chosen for top combat group commands&#x2014;from commanders like Dwight Eisenhower and Douglas MacArthur to some nearly forgotten.<br><br>Taaffe explores how and why Marshall selected the Armys commanders. Among his chief criteria were character (including unselfish and devoted purpose), education, (whether at West Point, Fort Leavenworth, or the Army War College), and striking a balance between experience and relative youth in a war that required both wisdom and great physical stamina. As the war unfolded, Marshall also factored into his calculations the combat leadership his generals demonstrated and the opinions of his theater commanders. <br><br>Taaffe brings into sharp focus the likes of Eisenhower, MacArthur, George Patton, Omar Bradley, Walter Krueger, Robert Eichelberger, Courtney Hodges, Lucian Truscott, J. Lawton Collins, Alexander Sandy Patch, Troy Middleton, Matthew Ridgeway, Mark Clark, and twenty-five other generals who served in the conflict. He describes their leadership and decision-making processes and provides miniature biographies and personality sketches of these men drawn from their personal papers, official records, and reflections of fellow officers.<br><br>Delving deeper than other studies, this path-breaking work produces a seamless analysis of Marshalls selection process of operational-level commanders. Taaffe also critiques the performance of these generals during the war and reveals the extent to which their actions served as stepping stones to advancement.<br><br>Ambitious in scope and filled with sharp insights, <i>Marshall and His Generals</i> is essential reading for anyone interested in World War II and military leadership more generally.</p><p>"A cogent, well-researched and important contribution to our understanding of Marshall and his corps, field army, and army group commanders."--Mark A. Stoler, editor of the George C. Marshall Papers<p> "Provides a marvelous synthesis of the specialized literature on the dozens of leading generals--some famous, many obscure--who directed the military campaigns in the European and Pacific theaters of war."--Michael Schaller, author of <i>Douglas MacArthur: Far Eastern General</i></p><p> "A superb portrait of a group of army officers that deserves to be read by everyone interested in World War II."--Jonathan House, author of <i>Combined Arms Warfare in the Twentieth Century</i></p><p> "A crisply written study and effective introduction to the relationship of Marshall and his lieutenants as they waged war in an extremely complex international conflict.

So which is it? Was George Washington a strategic genius or just lucky? So asks Dave R. Palmer in his new book, <i>George Washington&#x2019;s Military Genius</i>. An updated edition of Palmer's earlier work, <i>The Way of the Fox</i>, <i>George Washington&#x2019;s Military Genius</i> breaks down the American Revolution into four phases and analyzes Washington's strategy during each phrase. "<i>The British did not have to lose; the patriots did not have to triumph</i>," writes Palmer as he proves without a doubt that Washington's continuously-changing military tactics were deliberate, strategic responses to the various phases of the war, not because he lacked a plan of action. Confronting the critics who say Washington's battlefield success and ultimate victories were a function of luck, <i>George Washington's Military Genius</i> proves why the father of our country also deserves the title of America's preeminent strategist.</p><p>Too often George Washington gets dismissed as little more than a bumbling but lucky military leader. Not so, says distinguished military historian Dave R. Palmer in his compelling volume. Palmer shows in convincing fashion how Washington showed courageous flexibility in formulating the strategy that would bring the rebellious Americans victory in their War for Independence. From beginning to end, <i>George Washington&#x2019;s Military Genius</i> makes for gripping reading....Highly recommended!!"<br> James Kirby Martin, author of the award-winning <i>Benedict Arnold, Revolutionary Hero: An American Warrior Reconsidered</i><br><p><br> Too many Americans including scholars downplay Washington&#x2019;s military leadership, implying he was just the right man at the right place.

Bad endings can destroy good therapies. Good endings can consolidate the work accomplished, transform relationships, and foster growth in both patient and therapist. <br>Within the framework of the therapeutic relationship and a clearly articulated set of goals for therapy, Jack Novick and Kerry Kelly Novick describe how to recognize and respond to termination themes from the very beginning of treatment. Each phase of treatment brings its own challenges, as well as the risk of premature ending by patient or therapist. Each chapter in this book addresses specific danger signals to look out for and helpful techniques to support treatment.<br>With vivid clinical examples from all diagnostic groups and all stages of development, the Novicks demonstrate how to engage each patient in building the "emotional muscle" needed to master life's challenges, transform early losses, and integrate new experiences of joy and sadness into the personality.</p><p>PRAISE: "The Novicks have produced an excellent and most original book on termination in psychoanalysis and psychotherapy...At last we have an approach that conceives termination so fully, that it includes the concerns, and reasonable preparations for the patient self care after termination." --Henry Krystal, M.D., Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry, Michigan State University <p>"With generously supplied illustrative clinical vignettes, Kerry Kelly and Jack Novick have assembled a most valuable presentation concerning treatment termination. They demonstrate how the prospect of termination shapes the work of the entire collaboration, from its very onset through and beyond the final day that patient and analyst meet. Their detailed exposition, organized along the lines of a reader's expectable questions, throws clarifying light on an aspect of the treatment enterprise hitherto accorded but meager attention." --Stephen K. Firestein, M.D. </p><p>"GOOD GOODBYES is a fitting culmination of the Novicks' esteemed contributions to the literatures on termination, child and adult psychotherapies, and the 'two systems' model of self-esteem regulation. This thorough, practical, and wise volume on how to productively approach the ending of psychotherapies will be a great resource for experienced therapists and an invaluable guide to clinicians in training." --James Hansell, Ph.D, Department of Psychology, University of Michigan </p><p>"Nearly every therapist has watched in helpless agony when the good work of a patient's therapy is spoiled by a bad ending. In GOOD GOODBYES, the Novicks help us to minimize the possibility of such painful occurrences. Through an easy-to-follow series of questions and answers they walk us through the phases of intensive analytic treatment: from evaluation to beginning; from middle to pre-termination; and finally, from the much neglected phases of termination to post-termination. Through vivid and compelling child and adult clinical vignettes, they illuminate the challenges and satisfactions inherent in such work. Moreover, they demonstrate that when a treatment culminates in a "good, goodbye", a patient's system of self regulation can be transformed from one that is joyless, constricted and closed to one that is healthy, alive and open." --William B.

The reader follows the Klan&#39;s resurgence in 1915 after D.W. Griffith&#39;s epic film The Birth of a Nation depicted Klan members as heroic saviors of the old Southern society, to the swearing in of President Warren G. Harding as a Klansman in the Green Room. Wade explores the Klan&#39;s championing of white supremacy as a response to the Civil Rights movement in the 60s, through to their present day activities, aligning themselves with a variety of neo-fascist and right-wing groups in the American West. He concludes by offering an assessment of the Klan&#39;s future. The Fiery Cross provides an exhaustive analysis and perspective on this dark shadow of American society.</p><p>Wyn Craig Wade is an instructor of psychology at Ivy Tech State College in Indiana.This doggedly researched history of the American racist group is bloated with cliches, overstatements, colloquialisms, sensationalistic accounts of sexual atrocities and nonsensical connections (a detailed description of Grant's second inaugural ball that took place in an unheated building is followed by the observation that "over the next four years, the Republican ardor for civil rights would cool"). Wade's historical insights are often inane, as when he discusses Grant's suspension of habeas corpus in implementing the Ku-Klux Act: "Although it must be admitted that martial law is never pleasant, the effects of military occupation in South Carolina were far less dreadful than the picture anti-Reconstruction historians would popularize." And his psychological analyses are ludicrous: "Klan attacks on scalawags often involved some kind of sexual abuse. . . . as if the behavior of the scalawags represented a form of infidelity to the South, and Klansmen gladly assumed the role of vengeful spouses." Wade is the author of The Titanic: End of a Dream.

Between the ages of four and eighty-two his home was in Vienna; in 1938 Hitler's invasion of Austria forced him to seek asylum in London, where he died in the following year.His career began with several years of brilliant work on the anatomy and physiology of the nervous system. He was almost thirty when, after a period of study under Charcot in Paris, his interests first turned to psychology, and another ten years of clinical work in Vienna (at first in collaboration with Breuer, an older colleague) saw the birth of his creation, psychoanalysis. This began simply as a method of treating neurotic patients by investigating their minds, but it quickly grew into an accumulation of knowledge about the workings of the mind in general, whether sick or healthy. Freud was thus able to demonstrate the normal development of the sexual instinct in childhood and, largely on the basis of an examination of dreams, arrived at his fundamental discovery of the unconscious forces that influence our everyday thoughts and actions. Freud's life was uneventful, but his ideas have shaped not only many specialist disciplines, but the whole intellectual climate of the last half century.<br><br><b>A. A.

From the Japanese craze for the Ingurishu Gaaden-the English Garden-to the Dutch facility for cultivating myriad plant species to the American mania for mulberry trees in the eighteenth century, Elliott, with his trademark style and wit brings life to these episodes in horticultural history. He'll introduce you to great plant hunters such as the intrepid P�re Delavay and great plant planters such as the oddball John "Johnny Appleseed" Chapman. He'll take you to places as diverse as Cincinnati, Ohio-at one time the wine capital of America-to the jungle-choked gorges and valleys of the eastern flank of the Andes in search of the Fever Bark Tree. No other human pursuit can lead you into as many strange byways of history, science, and art as gardening can, and The Potting-Shed Papers is the perfect guide.

Real fishermen bait their fish into making bad decisions. Fundraisers might strategize about &#34;fishing in the right ponds,&#34; &#34;choosing the right donor hook,&#34; or &#34;reeling in a huge catch.&#34; They may even tell fish stories about &#34;the big one&#34; they landed or even &#34;the one that got away.&#34; But these images wrongly imply that fundraising means luring someone into doing something they will eventually regret. Instead of fishing, a better analogy for fundraising can be seen in Jesus&#39; lesson about prayer.</p><p></p><h2>The Glass Rainbow: A Dave Robicheaux Novel</h2><p>The creator of &#x201c;one of America&#x2019;s best mystery series&#x201d; (<i>Library Journal, </i>starred review), <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author James Lee Burke features Louisiana detective Dave Robicheaux in a &#x201c;superlative&#x201d; (<i>Publishers Weekly, </i>starred review) bayou thriller.<br><br>The brutal murders of seven young women in a neighboring parish pull Robicheaux from his New Iberia home into a case with all the telltale signs of a serial killer.

The ventilated storm shutters were slatted with a pink glow, as soft and filtered and cool in color as the spring sunrise can be in the Garden District, the courtyard outside touched with mist off the river, the pastel walls deep in shadow and stained with lichen above the flower beds, the brick walkways smelling of damp stone and the wild spearmint that grew in green clusters between the bricks. I could see the shadows of banana trees moving on the window screens, the humidity condensing and threading along the fronds like veins in living tissue. I could hear a ship&#x2019;s horn blowing somewhere out on the river, a long hooting sound that was absorbed and muted inside the mist, thwarting its own purpose. A wood-bladed fan revolved slowly above my bed, the incandescence of the lightbulbs attached to it reduced to a dim yellow smudge inside frosted-glass shades that were fluted to resemble flowers. The wood floor and the garish wallpaper and the rain spots on the ceiling belonged to another era, one that was outside of time and unheedful of the demands of commerce. Perhaps as a reminder of that fact, the only clock in the room was a round windup mechanism that possessed neither a glass cover nor hands on its face.<br><br>There are moments in the Deep South when one wonders if he has not wakened to a sunrise in the spring of 1862. And in that moment, maybe one realizes with a guilty pang that he would not find such an event entirely unwelcome.<br><br>At midmorning, inside a pine-wooded depression not far from the Mississippi, I found the man I was looking for. His name was Jimmy Darl Thigpin, and the diminutive or boylike image his name suggested, as with many southern names, was egregiously misleading. He was a gunbull of the old school, the kind of man who was neither good nor bad, in the way that a firearm is neither good nor bad. He was the kind of man whom you treat with discretion and whose private frame of reference you do not probe. In some ways, Jimmy Darl Thigpin was the lawman all of us fear we might one day become.<br><br>He sat atop a quarter horse that was at least sixteen hands high, his back erect, a cut-down double-barrel twelve-gauge propped on his thigh, the saddle creaking under his weight. He wore a long-sleeved cotton shirt to protect his arms from mosquitoes, and a beat-up, tall-crown cowboy hat in the apparent belief that he could prevent a return of the skin cancer that had shriveled one side of his face. To my knowledge, in various stages of his forty-year career, he had killed five men, some inside the prison system, some outside, one in an argument over a woman in a bar.<br><br>His charges were all black men, each wearing big-stripe green-and-white convict jumpers and baggy pants, some wearing leather-cuffed ankle restraints. They were felling trees, chopping off the limbs for burning, stacking the trunks on a flatbed truck, the heat from the fire so intense it gave off no smoke.<br><br>When he saw me park on the road, he dismounted and broke open the breech of his shotgun, cradling it over his left forearm, exposing the two shells in the chambers, effectively disarming his weapon. But in spite of his show of deference for my safety, there was no pleasure in his expression when he shook hands, and his eyes never left his charges.<br><br>&#x201c;We appreciate your calling us, Cap,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It looks like you&#x2019;re still running a tight ship.&#x201d;<br><br>Then I thought about what I had just said. There are instances when the exigencies of your life or profession require that you ingratiate yourself with people who make you uncomfortable, not because of what they are but because you fear their approval and the possibility you are more like them than you are willing to accept. I kept believing that age would one day free me of that burden. But it never has.<br><br>My introspection was of no relevance. He seemed uncertain about the purpose of my visit to Mississippi, even though it was he who had contacted me about one of his charges. &#x201c;This is about those hookers that was killed over in your area?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t necessarily call them that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right, I shouldn&#x2019;t be speaking unkindly of the dead. The boy I was telling you about is over yonder. The one with the gold teeth.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks for your help, Cap.&#x201d;<br><br>Maybe my friend the gunbull wasn&#x2019;t all bad, I told myself. But sometimes when you think you&#x2019;re almost home free, that indeed redemption is working incrementally in all of us, you find you have set yourself up for another disappointment.<br><br>&#x201c;His nickname is Git-It-and-Go,&#x201d; Thigpin said.<br><br>&#x201c;Sir?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be feeling sorry for him. He could steal the stink off shit and not get the smell on his hands. If he don&#x2019;t give you what you want, let me know and I&#x2019;ll slap a knot on his head.&#x201d;<br><br>Jimmy Darl Thigpin opened a pouch of string tobacco and filled his jaw with it. He chewed slowly, his eyes hazy with a private thought or perhaps the pleasure the tobacco gave him. Then he realized I was watching him, and he grinned at the corner of his mouth to indicate he and I were members of the same club.<br><br>The convict&#x2019;s name was Elmore Latiolais. He came from a rural slum sixty miles northeast of New Iberia, where I was employed as a detective with the Iberia Parish Sheriff&#x2019;s Department. His facial features were Negroid, but his skin was the color of paste, covered with large moles as thick and irregular in shape as drops of mud, his wiry hair peroxided a bright gold. He was one of those recidivists whose lives are a testimony to institutional failure and the fact that for some people and situations there are no solutions.<br><br>We sat on a log in the shade, thirty yards from where his crew was working. The air was breathless and superheated inside the clearing, the trash fire red-hot at the center, the freshly cut pine limbs snapping instantly alight when they hit the flames. Elmore Latiolais was sweating heavily, his body wrapped in an odor that was like mildew and soapy water that had dried in his clothes.<br><br>&#x201c;Why we got to talk here, man?&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry I didn&#x2019;t bring an air-conditioned office with me,&#x201d; I replied.<br><br>&#x201c;They gonna make me for a snitch.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I drove a long way to talk with you, podna. Would you rather I leave?&#x201d;<br><br>His eyes searched in space, his alternatives, his agenda, the pitiful issues of his life probably swimming like dots in the heat waves warping off the fire.<br><br>&#x201c;My sister was Bernadette, one of them seven girls that&#x2019;s been killed, that don&#x2019;t nobody care about,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;Captain Thigpin explained that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My grandmother sent me the news article. It was from November of last year. My grandmother says ain&#x2019;t nothing been written about them since. The article says my sister and all them others was prostitutes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not exactly. But yeah, the article suggests that. What are you trying to tell me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It ain&#x2019;t fair.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not fair?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right. Calling my sister a prostitute. Nobody interested in the troot. All them girls just t&#x2019;rown away like they was sacks of garbage.&#x201d; He wiped his nose with the heel of his hand.<br><br>&#x201c;You know who&#x2019;s behind their deaths?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Herman Stanga.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What do you base that on?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Herman Stanga tried to have me jooged when I was in Angola.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Herman Stanga is a pimp.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re telling me a pimp is mixed up with your sister&#x2019;s death but your sister was not a prostitute? Does that seem like a reasonable conclusion to you?&#x201d;<br><br>He turned his face to mine. &#x201c;Where you been, man?&#x201d;<br><br>I propped my hands on my knees, stiffening my arms, my expression blank, waiting for the balloon of anger in my chest to pass. &#x201c;You asked Captain Thigpin to call me. Why me and not somebody else?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My cousin tole me you was axing around about the girls. But I t&#x2019;ink you got your head stuffed up your hole.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Forgive me if I&#x2019;m losing patience with this conversation.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no money in selling cooze no more. Herman Stanga is into meth. You got to come to Mis&#x2019;sippi and interview somebody on a road gang to find that out?&#x201d;<br><br>I stood up, my gaze focused on neutral space. &#x201c;I have several photographs here I&#x2019;d like you to look at. Tell me if you know any of these women.&#x201d;<br><br>There were seven photos in my shirt pocket. I removed only six of them. He remained seated on the log and went through them one by one. None of the photos was a mug shot. They had been taken by friends or family members using cheap cameras and one-hour development services. The backdrops were in poor neighborhoods where the residents parked their cars in the yards and the litter in the rain ditches disappeared inside the weeds during the summer and was exposed again during the winter. Two of the victims were white, four were black. Some of them were pretty. All of them were young. None of them looked unhappy. None of them probably had any idea of the fate that awaited them.<br><br>&#x201c;They all lived sout&#x2019; of the tracks, didn&#x2019;t they?&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right. Do you recognize them?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, I ain&#x2019;t seen none of them. You ain&#x2019;t shown me my sister&#x2019;s picture.&#x201d;<br><br>I removed the seventh photo from my pocket and handed it to him. The girl in it had been seventeen when she died. She was last seen leaving a dollar store at four o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon. She had a sweet, round face and was smiling in the photograph.<br><br>Elmore Latiolais cupped the photo in his palm. He stared at it for a long time, then shielded his eyes as though avoiding the sun&#x2019;s glare. &#x201c;Can I keep it?&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; I replied.<br><br>He nodded and returned the photo to me, his eyes moist, his gold Brillo pad of a haircut popping with sweat.<br><br>&#x201c;You said you hadn&#x2019;t seen any of the other victims. How did you know they lived south of the tracks?&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I mean when I say you got your head up your ass. If they lived nort&#x2019; of the railroad track, y&#x2019;all would be tearing the state of Lou&#x2019;sana apart to get the man who killed them.&#x201d;<br><br>Elmore Latiolais was not a likable man. In all probability, he had committed crimes that were worse in nature than those for which he had been punished. But the fact he considered Herman Stanga a cancer indicated, at least to me, that Elmore was still held together by the same glue as the rest of us. Herman Stanga was another matter. Herman Stanga was a man I hated, maybe less for what he was personally than what he represented, but I hated him just the same, to the degree that I did not want to be armed and alone with him.<br><br>I said good-bye to Elmore Latiolais.<br><br>&#x201c;You ain&#x2019;t gonna he&#x2019;p out?&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t told me anything that could be considered of investigative value.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;&#x2018;Investigative value&#x2019;? Yeah, I like them kind of words. Herman killed a cousin of mine ten years back. He give her a hotshot and blew her heart out. When he knowed I was onto him, he paid a guy to joog me. Y&#x2019;all wasn&#x2019;t interested then, y&#x2019;all ain&#x2019;t interested now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry for your loss,&#x201d; I replied.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>HERMAN WAS ONE of those singular individuals for whom there is no adequate categorical description. He deliberately created addiction among his own people by giving what he called &#x201c;entrepreneurial start-up flake&#x201d; to teenage dealers. He encouraged his rock queens to eat fried food so their extra weight would signal to their customers that they were AIDS-free. He pimped off his white girls to black johns and his black girls to white johns. If a perv who liked it rough got into the mix, that was just the way it flushed sometimes. &#x201c;Harry Truman integrated the United States Army. I&#x2019;m taking multiculturalism and equal opportunity to a much higher level,&#x201d; he liked to say.<br><br>By his own definition of himself, he was always rocking to his own rhythms, high on his own rebop and snap-crackle-and-pop, and didn&#x2019;t &#x201c;need to slam no gram to be what I am.&#x201d; He had the face of a pixie, his mustache trimmed into tiny black wings on his upper lip, his eyes bright with innocent mischief, the harmless satyr peeking out of the bushes. His physique was hard and lean, his skin stretched tight on his bones and tendons like a meth addict&#x2019;s, though he used drugs rarely, and only for recreational purposes. He liked to kick off his clothes by the poolside, down to his white silk boxer shorts, and sunbathe on a floating air mattress in the middle of his swimming pool, wraparound Ray-Bans on his face, a frozen daiquiri balanced on his stomach, his sunblock trailing off the ends of his fingers, his phallus as pronounced as the wood figure on a sailing ship&#x2019;s prow. The neighbors complained because of the exposure to their children, but Herman literally gave them the finger, hiking it in the air whenever he saw them gazing at him from their windows. Herman Stanga was above convention. Herman Stanga was the iconoclast whose irreverence had made him rich while the assets of his neighbors drained through a sinkhole called the recession of 2009.<br><br>He had acquired his home on Bayou Teche, a faux antebellum two-story brick structure with twin chimneys, from a black physician who signed over the property for a minimal sum and left town with his wife and children and was never heard from again. Maintenance of the house and grounds ended the day Herman moved in. The hollow wood pillars were eaten by termites. The ventilated green storm shutters hung askew on their hinges; the rain gutters were clogged with pine needles and bled rust down the window frames. The manicured St. Augustine lawn was destroyed by mold and weed infestation and chains of red-ant mounds. Herman&#x2019;s Dobermans dug holes in the flower beds and downloaded piles of dog shit on every square inch of dirt they could squat on.<br><br>Herman, like a Leonardo da Vinci in reverse, had turned his own home into an emblematic masterpiece of suburban decay.<br><br>I rang the chimes, but no one answered. When I walked around back, I saw him cleaning leaves and pine needles out of the pool with a long pole, wearing Speedos that exposed his crack and his pubic hair. He had the most peculiar coloration I had ever seen in a human being. It was like black ivory that someone had poured liquefied gold inside. The afternoon sun had already dipped behind the oak trees on the bayou, and his wet hair and the oily glaze on his skin seemed touched with fire. A chicken was turning on a rotisserie over a bed of charcoals, next to a glass-topped table that was inset with an umbrella. In the shade of the umbrella was a cooler packed with crushed ice and bottles of Mexican and German beer.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s my man RoboCop,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Sit yourself down, my brother, and open yourself a beer.&#x201d;<br><br>A striped robe like a Bedouin would wear hung over the back of a canvas chair. I picked it up and threw it at him. &#x201c;Put it on.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What for?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your neighbor&#x2019;s kids are looking through the gate.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right, it&#x2019;s starting to cool off,&#x201d; he said. He wrapped the robe around his midriff and tied it like a sarong, his chin tilted up into the breeze.

Each title emphasizes one phonics family, the first five books in each set focusing on one vowel sound, and the remaining four books combining some vowel sounds or reviewing them all. Short vowel families are covered in Level 1 readers and long vowel families in Level 2 books. Fiction titles feature attractive illustrations and have story themes ranging from funny to serious. Each fiction title also suggests a brief activity that allows kids to interact with the book&#x2019;s subject matter. Nonfiction titles are photo illustrated, and include &#x201c;Fun Facts&#x201d; to enrich children&#x2019;s reading experiences. The nonfiction books contain the basic elements of a nonfiction book, including glossary and index. They also suggest web sites appropriate to kids&#x2019; interests where more information about each book&#x2019;s subject is offered. Both fiction and nonfiction titles contain word lists that group each book&#x2019;s words into &#x201c;decodable&#x201d; words&#x2014;those containing the book&#x2019;s main vowel sound, which the book is either teaching or reviewing. Word lists also include high-frequency words and challenging words included in the main text. All books present a letter to parents and teachers explaining the fundamental concepts underlying both the series and the specific title. Level 1 readers are designed for classroom or home schooling use in preschool and kindergarten, and Level 2 readers for kindergarten and grade 1. &#x201c;Joe Boat&#x201d; is a story that covers the &#x201c;long o&#x201d; sound.</p><p>(back cover) <br> <b> Reader&#x2019;s <br> Clubhouse <br> LEVEL 2 <br> READING SUCCESS IN EASY STEPS </b> <br> <br> Learn the sound: read the word.

Characters in these novels must learn to negotiate the levels of power that exist in the myriad social institutions within which they function, including family, church, government, and school.</p> <p>Trites argues that the development of the genre over the past thirty years is an outgrowth of postmodernism, since YA novels are, by definition, texts that interrogate the social construction of individuals. Drawing on such nineteenth-century precursors as <i>Little Women</i> and <i>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,</i> <i>Disturbing the Universe</i> demonstrates how important it is to employ poststructuralist methodologies in analyzing adolescent literature, both in critical studies and in the classroom. Among the twentieth-century authors discussed are Blume, Hamilton, Hinton, Le Guin, L'Engle, and Zindel.</p> <p>Trites' work has applications for a broad range of readers, including scholars of children's literature and theorists of post-modernity as well as librarians and secondary-school teachers.</p> <p><i>Disturbing the Universe: Power and Repression in Adolescent Literature</i> by Roberta Seelinger Trites is the winner of the 2002 Children's Literature Association's Book Award. The award is given annually in order to promote and recognize outstanding contributions to children's literature, history, scholarship, and criticisim; it is one of the highest academic honors that can accrue to an author of children's literary criticism.</p> <p> </p></p><p>The author deconstructs a number of YA novels by writers such as Francesca Lia Block, Chris Crutcher, Virginia Hamilton, S. E. Hinton, Madeleine L'Engle, and Paul Zindel, analyzing how adolescents negotiate their place in the power structures in their lives (school, family, religion, identity, government). The author also discusses how sex, death, and money both empower and repress teen protagonists. She believes that adolescent characters understand their own power (or lack thereof) by struggling with these institutions. A plethora of philosophies and theories (Freud, Foucault, Lacan, etc.) is cited as Trites looks intently at elements of narrative structure, metaphorical constructs, ideologies, and more. This is a complicated, detailed, and intellectual analysis, not for the faint of brain or casual aficionado; however, it is an interesting treatise about an important body of literature.<br><i>Bette Ammon, Missoula Public Library, MT </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.Young adult literature is flourishing, and the critics are giving it serious attention. Trites' talk about "poststructural pedagogy," "institutional discourses," and other abstractions seems to overwhelm discussion of the novels. But once you get past the jargon, her consideration of landmark books--The Chocolate War, Lyddie, Nothing but the Truth, Arilla Sun Down, and more--is thought provoking, especially her arguments that these stories are about questions of power more than about self-discovery and coming-of-age. Give this to advanced YA literature classes and to those English faculty members open to teaching something new. <i>Hazel Rochman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

These clubs have justifiably attained an international reputation: both Southport and Ainsdale and Royal Birkdale have hosted Ryder Cup matches with the U.S., and Royal Birkdale is a regular venue for the Open Championship; while West Lancashire, Formby, Hillside, and Hesketh have for many years staged major championships and representative matches, both amateur and professional. A feature of this golfing coast is Merseyrail&#39;s Northern Line. West Lancashire, Formby, Southport, and Ainsdale and Hillside all have holes where a slice or a pull will put a ball over the railway fence and out of bounds. The same was true of the Freshfield Club until the Royal Air Force requisitioned its links for an airfield during World War II. Royal Birkdale does not flank &#34;the Line,&#34; although contemporary professionals could probably drive a ball from this course, across the Hillside links, onto the railway. This book tells the story of the pioneers who founded the clubs, emphasizing the critical roles played by the landowners and the railway company and the relationship of the promotion of golf to their commercial interests. It examines of the visionary contribution of the local authority and the crucial inter-relationships between the clubs in the early years. The golfers, many members of more than one of the clubs, truly formed a community. Golf in south-west Lancashire is placed in its social, economic, and spatial setting and it is argued that golf was not merely a response to change but one of the engines of change.</p><p>Harry Foster&nbsp;is the author of&nbsp;nine books, including histories of the Hesketh and Southport and Ainsdale golf clubs. An enthusiastic sportsman, Harry was a member of the championship-winning Lancashire rugby team of the early 1950s, an England trialist, and reserve for the England XV. He has been a member of the Hesketh Golf Club for&nbsp;more than 40&nbsp;years, and is a past Captain.</p><h2>Nine Women</h2><p>Tells the stories of women facing turning points in their lives, from divorce to survival of a plane crash</p><p>Infrequent in appearance, Grau's books are always an occasion for celebration. The nine stories in this new collectionall with a woman as their central characterconfirm her as a writer of keen psychological insight and luminously resonating prose. Grau's sensibility has an amazing range: outside of the Southern heritage they share, her women inhabit different social, economic and cultural worlds. "Hunter" concerns the only survivor of a plane crash that kills her family, who thereafter pursues her own surcease. Marvelously restrained, with every word polished to a burning clarity, the story engulfs and mesmerizes the reader. In "Ending," the wedding of the daughter of an affluent black couple signals the dissolution of their marriage and exposes the disillusion that has eroded their upwardly mobile lives. Perfect in pitch and tone, "Home" captures an emotional confrontation between two women who are lovers, but ends in a reaffirmation of their vital connection. Grau's gently ironic sympathy permeates these tales. Though little overt action occurs, the forces that tether people to responsibilities, to rituals and traditions, to family loyalties, and, most tellingly, to life, are gracefully illumined. Franklin Library First Edition Society selection. January 20<br>Copyright 1985 Reed Business Information, Inc.Grau's short stories are peopled by men and women who embrace habit and tradition. But while their rituals comfort, they also mask communication. The parents who live on a rigid schedule in "Letting Go" cannot talk to their daughter; the wedding ceremony in "Ending" also marks the end of the parents' marriage; and a yearly Labor Day clambake in "Summer Shore" is more a celebration of superficial "summer friends" than of the end of the season. Unfortunately, the style does not measure up to Grau's previous work: the quality of the dialogue is uneven, the prose marred by cliches and repetitive metaphors. From the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning The Keepers of the House, these stories are disappointing.

The Ya-Yas are the wild circle of girls who swirl around the narrator Siddalee's mama, Vivi, whose vivid voice is "part Scarlett, part Katharine Hepburn, part Tallulah." The Ya-Yas broke the no-booze rule at the cotillion, skinny-dipped their way to jail in the town water tower, disrupted the Shirley Temple look-alike contest, and bonded for life because, as one says, "It's so much <i>fun</i> being a bad girl!" <p> Siddalee must repair her busted relationship with Vivi by reading a half-century's worth of letters and clippings contained in the Ya-Ya Sisterhood's packet of "Divine Secrets." It's a contrived premise, but the secrets are really fun to learn.</p>Now, four years after her award-winning, underground bestseller,<strong> </strong><em>Little Altars Everywhere,</em> praised by Pat Conroy as "a splendid first novel," Rebecca Wells returns with a masterfully written novel that brims with insight, humor and compassion. <p>When Vivi and Siddalee Walker, an unforgettable mother-daughter team, get into a savage fight over a <em>New York Times</em> article that refers to Vivi as a "tap-dancing child abuser," the fallout is felt from Louisiana to New York to Seattle. Siddalee, a successful theater director with a huge hit on her hands, panics and postpones her upcoming wedding to her lover and friend, Connor McGill. Vivi's intrepid gang of lifelong girlfriends, the Ya-Yas, sashay in and conspire to bring everyone back together. </p><p>In 1932, Vivi and the Ya-Yas were disqualified from a Shirley Temple Look-Alike Contest for unladylike behavior. Sixty years later, they're "bucking seventy" and still making waves. They persuade Vivi to send Sidda a scrapbook of girlhood mementos titled "Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood." </p><p>With the scrapbook in hand, Sidda retreats to a cabin on Washington State's Olympic Peninsula, tormented by fear and uncertainty about the future, and intent on discovering the key to the tangle of anger and tenderness she feels toward her mother. But Vivi's album reveals more questions than answers and leads Sidda to encounter the legacy of imperfect love and the unknowable mystery of life. </p><p>With passion and a rare gift for language, Rebecca Wells moves from present to past, unraveling Vivi's life, her enduring friendships with the Ya-Yas and the reverberations of Siddalee. The collective power of the Ya-Yas, each of them totally individual and authentic, permeates this story of a tribe of Louisiana wild women who are impossible to tame. </p><p><em>Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood</em> calls to mind <em>The Joy Luck Club</em> in its exploration of the relationships between mothers and daughters; in its unearthing of family secrets, it evokes <em>The Prince of Tides.</em> Ultimately, in its aching longing, in its deep humor, in its heartbreaking fun and in its joy and forgiveness, Rebecca Wells has created a big, original, incandescent novel whose Louisiana landscape and indelible characters radiate with grace, wit and love.</p><p>When Siddalee Walker, oldest daughter of Vivi Abbott Walker, Ya-Ya extraordinaire, is interviewed in the <em>New York Times</em> about a hit play she's directed, her mother gets described as a "tap-dancing child abuser." Enraged, Vivi disowns Sidda. Devastated, Sidda begs forgiveness, and postpones her upcoming wedding. All looks bleak until the Ya-Yas step in and convince Vivi to send Sidda a scrapbook of their girlhood mementos, called "Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood." As Sidda struggles to analyze her mother, she comes face to face with the tangled beauty of imperfect love, and the fact that forgiveness, more than understanding, is often what the heart longs for. </p><p><em>Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood</em> may call to mind <em>Prince of Tides</em> in its unearthing of family darkness; in its unforgettable heroines and irrepressible humor and female loyalty, it echoes Fannie Flagg's <em>Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe.</em> </p></p><h2>In Another Place, Not Here</h2><p>When two contemporary Caribbean women just happen to meet, an instant friendship and understanding forms as a yearning for each other&#39;s life takes them to the next stage in their own worlds.</p><p>This is poet, essayist, and film-maker Dionne Brand's first novel. The same sensuous language and imagery that informs her other work is present in this story of two contemporary Caribbean women. Elizete and Verlia appear to be opposites. Elizete is a poor islander who dreams of escaping to a life of freedom and prosperity in a city. Verlia is a jaded Canadian who leaves Toronto to return to her island homeland where she hopes to find revolution and authenticity. Each woman sees her fantasy in the other, comparing their urban and rural lifestyles, material wealth and poverty, and different spiritualities. While this book is certainly about the differences between the two women's lives, it is also very much about the power of our fantasies and how we project onto people the things we want to see. Brand's supple, poetic prose is well-suited for her many-textured subject. <i>--Rebecca Brown</i><p>"A fierce, sensuous novel of women in migration, political and emotional. Concrete and visionary as a dream, relentless as the history it reveals, <i>In Another Place, Not Here</i> is a work of great beauty and moral imagination." -Adrienne Rich</p> <p>"With this book, this marvellous love letter, Brand emerges as a writer of the first rank--. She combines folklore with poetry in a manner that recalls Michael Ondaatje, and she writes reportage like Mavis Gallant. This book is one of the classics of our culture."- <i>Halifax Chronicle-Herald</i></p> <p>"--One of the best Canadian [novels] that I have read in the last ten years. [It] touches the centre of Canadian experience, dealing with our racism, embracing the possibility of confrontation and of cure." -Austin Clarke, <i>The Toronto Star</i></p> <p>"This is simply a stunning book." -<i>The Globe and Mail</i></p> <i><br></i></p><h2>The Diary and Life of William Byrd II of Virginia, 1674-1744</h2><p>This eloquent and provocative essay describes the emergence of a Virginia gentleman. Sent to England for an education, William Byrd II soon learned to emulate the ideals of English gentility. In 1704 the thirty-year-old Byrd inherited his father's estates in Virginia, but he lived in England for much of the next twenty-five years pursuing his political ambitions. Thwarted in his efforts to obtain either the position to which he aspired or a wealthy bride, Byrd finally faced personal and financial ruin. Only then did he come to be both literally and figuratively at home in Virginia. <br> <br>The story is told through Kenneth Lockridge's compelling reading of a seemingly intractable source: Byrd's secret diaries. Drawing upon psychohistory, social psychology, cultural anthropology, and literary criticism, Lockridge relates the narrative of a single life, of a person struggling for realization within the context of a Virginia aristocracy itself striving for a mature conception of its role. He captures the essence of what it was to become a Virginia gentleman, and the terrible price leading Virginians paid for the eventual success of their class. <br> <br>In the process, Lockridge demonstrates how a close reading of literary texts can reveal large historical themes. He explores the politics of the eighteenth-century colonial and imperial world and reveals the exact moment at which a matured colonial gentry seized the initiative from its British masters -- fifty years before the Revolution.</p><p></p><h2>One Man&#39;s Art (Silhouette Language of Love #17)</h2><p><b>A New York Times Bestselling Author</b><p> Her car had stalled on an isolated road in Maine, and Genevieve Grandeau found herself pounding on the door of an old lighthouse.
